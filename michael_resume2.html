<p>However, after five years independent consulting, I think I know what it
is I do, basically: whatever people pay me to do.  In practice, this is mostly
the development of online databases and other active-content sites.  I'm getting
halfway decent at layout, and this interfaces well with my strong database
skills.</p>
<p>
You can get an idea of my experience either <a href="#keyword">by keyword</a> or <a href="#chron">in a more traditional chronological
list</a>.  The disadvantage of the chronological list is that so many things overlap in the last few years.  However, it's interesting
from a historical perspective; the laundry list below only contains skills in which I consider myself current.

I've got a couple of publications to my name.  So far they're all at IBM's devWorks, but hey, I'm getting
paid real money for this stuff and they're pretty decent articles.

<tr><td><b>March 2001</b> - IBM <i>developerWorks</i> site.
<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/wftk.html">Workflow toolkit: Case study of an open source project</a><br>
The first article I wrote for pay, this was about my experiences in the original <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/wftk/">wftk project</a>.
I don't care for the article much, as I couldn't really figure out what the heck it was I was writing about, but I recently discovered
it's been <a href="http://www.cn.ibm.com/developerWorks/opensource/wftk/index.shtml">translated into Chinese</a>, so that more than
makes up for its original shortcomings.  Cooool.  Oh, and <a href="http://www-6.ibm.com/jp/developerworks/opensource/001103/j_wftk.html">Japanese</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>March 2001</b> - IBM <i>developerWorks</i> site.
<a href=http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-wxpy/>wxPython for newbies</a><br>A short article
about using wxPython for cross-platform GUI development.

<tr><td><b>May 2001</b> - IBM <i>developerWorks</i> site.
<a href=http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-zope>Zope for the Perl/CGI programmer</a><br>
I really like this article.  It's about Zope; you probably already figured that out, though.  It's all part
of my let-IBM-pay-for-learning-new-tech strategy.  So far this strategy is working out pretty well.
