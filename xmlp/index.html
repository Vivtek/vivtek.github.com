Finally getting down to business writing a real code documentation system.  It'll get put through its paces during coding
for the <a href=/wftk.html>wftk</a>.  I'm getting on a real roll with four-letter vowelless acronyms <i>and I like it</i>.
(And note that FLVA is <i>not</i> an FLVA.)

   Improved formatting (well, I think so anyway) and added subitems so that smaller structure can be documented on a
   single page instead of spreading things out over many pages.  <a href=/xmlp/xmlp_alpha/tangle.html>The tangle
   item</a> is a bad example but the only example until I rework some of the other areas.

</td><td>
  I'm starting this in conjunction with the coding effort for the <a href=/wftk.html>open-source workflow toolkit</a>.
  Since the wftk is my first open-source project (and this will be my second) I feel as though it should be documented to
  a much higher standard than my earlier work, which has never been for public consumption.  I've always commented fairly
  carefully, but open source should do better than that.  Design decisions should be documented and so forth.  You know the
  drill.  If you're not familiar with literate programming, by the way, <a href=/litprog.html>please read my introduction
  to the topic</a> and maybe follow some of the links.  Worth your while.
  <p>
  At any rate, the first run at this will be XMLP-alpha, which is a very minimal Perl script which will do very basic
  tangle and weave.  (Tangle and weave are <i>not</i> considered separate operations in this system, but I still talk
  about those aspects of processing as though they were.)
  <p>
  XMLP is financially supported by no-one.  If you think you want to send me money or something, I'm sure something can be
  arranged.  Otherwise, if you want to use the beast, feel free.  It will be available under the GNU license very soon, and
  other licensing arrangements can be discussed, of course.  More on that when I get something to show, which should be
  relatively soon, as I feel the Muse on me.

  The XML I'll use for this effort (at least the first time around) will be rather simple; it's the result of maybe
  five years' thought about literate programming and why I do and don't like it, combined with my sudden recent plunge
  into XML in the framework of the wftk project.  XML is cool, really cool.  The more you think about it, the more you
  wonder why you spent all those years working without it -- <a href=/xml.html>I have an introductory topic</a>, of course,
  but it needs updating because I wrote it before I did much with XML.  Months ago.
  <p>
  Anyway, <a href=/xmlp/language.html>here is the definition of the language</a>, and at some point I may write a valid DTD
  for it.  For the time being, it's sort of bastard XML instead of real live XML, and I don't really care.  So there.

</td><td>
  XMLP alpha is a prototype Perl script.  It has lots of limitations, up to and including
  the fact that it really doesn't parse XML all that well, but it does take an XML-like
  source code, tangle and weave it, and produce results.  Of course, the only thing I've
  used it to produce is itself (and <i>that</i> was rife with meta-confusion!) but I hope
  that will change soon.
  <p>
  <a href=/xmlp/xmlp_alpha/index.html>Go look at it</a>, and even <a href=/xmlp/xmlp_alpha/xmlp_alpha.txt>download
  it and give it a whirl</a> if you want to give me a little feedback.  I'd like to hear what
  you have to think.
  <p>
  It's just a taste of what's to come, I hope.
