The SourceXchange model is pretty intricate, and only yesterday did I realize that the
original mess I drew didn't work out because I was trying to model several processes in a
single definition.
<p>
There are three processes in a SourceXchange project.  The first is the overall SourceXchange
process, as follows:<ol>
<b><li>Proposer selects an RFP and writes a proposal, and submits it to the Sponsor.</b>
<b><li>Sponsor accepts proposal</b><br> Obviously if the proposal isn't accepted, nothing else happens.
    Note that this effectively means a moribund process.
<b><li>Proposer creates a project plan, including milestones and assigns Developer</b><br>
    Initial milestones are technically part of the proposal, but after a formal project
    plan has been developed, it's likely that the milestones will be modified somewhat, at
    least with respect to order.
<b><li>SourceXchange assigns Reviewer.</b>
<b><li>SourceXchange sets up formal milestones</b><br>
    Note that the formal milestones are a <i>simplified</i>
    version of the project plan.
<b><li>Developer(s) execute the project plan.</b><br>
    This is getting to be a common theme, isn't it?  Create a project plan and execute the
    project plan.
<b><li>Upon completion of each milestone, the signoff process is executed.</b><br>
    Here's where it gets interesting.  The signoff process, defined below, is parameterized
    with respect to the milestone being signed off.  This is a new twist.
<b><li>When all milestones are complete, Sponsor and Reviewer review the finished product
       and accept it.</b>
<b><li>SourceXchange makes the code available onsite.</b>
</ol>

The signoff process, invoked for each completed milestone, is as follows:<ol>
<b><li>Developer announces milestone</b>
<b><li>Sponsor and Reviewer review milestone.</b><br>
   If the sponsor refuses the milestone, but the milestone is accepted by the Reviewer, then
   something very odd happens.  The current signoff subprocess runs to completion, but <i>the
   main process, the parent's parent process, is aborted!</i>  This requires a formal exception model
   and the facilities to define exception handling.
<b><li>SourceXchange pays Proposer</b>
</ol>

<i>(2/21/00) <a href=../process_defn/sxc_defn.html>XML process definition here.</a></i>
<p>

<i>Complex compound process</i><br>
So we have three process definitions here which interact in a rather complex way: the main
process, the project plan subprocess, and the signoff process.  Each task in the project
plan, then, effectively represents an instance of the signoff process.  And this is 
specified when the main process invokes the project plan.
<p>
When an exception is encountered in the signoff process (the Sponsor rejects a milestone
when the Reviewer accepts) then the <i>main</i> process must take action.  We can very easily
consider a project-abort process as well.
The notion of a compound process, then, is a quite powerful one, especially when you throw
in the idea of parameterization.
<p>
<i>Administration via workflow</i><br>
When you consider that completion of <i>each task</i> in the project plan invokes the
signoff subprocess, then it starts to make sense that <i>any</i> action taken by the
workflow system might best be represented as a process, requiring any number of interactions
by people or programs, and notification of any number of people, recording of arbitrary
data, or whatever.  This is one of the suggestions I made in my original proposal.  Given
that the system is a workflow system, then any aspect of its operation should be configurable
by specification of a process.  Right?  So to add a user to a group, a process is potentially
invoked.  To assign a user to a task, a process is invoked.  Arbitrary processes may be
used to do this, or simple default processes will be used instead.  Make sense?
<p>
<i>Summary:</i><br>
These summaries are getting repetitive, but that's because this is the last usage scenario.
It's time to get on to the user interface and process definition DTD, and then get coding!
<ul>
<li>Exception handling: a subsubprocess, in this case, can cause an exception in the main process.
<li>Parameterized invocation of processes and subprocesses.
<li>Completion of each task in a given process may itself be a subprocess.
<li>Any operation performed by the system is potentially regulated as a (sub)process.  This
    process may be a systemwide default, a systemwide configuration, or a process-specific
    configuration, so that user assignment, for instance, may be done in one way for one
    process and in another way for a different process.
</ul>
I think that's about it.
