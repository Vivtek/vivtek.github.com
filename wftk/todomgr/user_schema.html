The user table, as indicated, has a sort of temporary aspect for me.  But I need it implemented
in order to get a prototype demo off the ground, so here it is.  It will probably be replaced
by some directory module or something as soon as I figure out how all that works.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>userid text,
password text,
permlevel smallint,
name text,
email text,
website text
</pre></td></tr></table>

Here are what the fields are supposed to be for:<ul>
<b><li>userid, password</b> - obvious.<br>
The password will be plaintext for this demo just to cut corners.  Not a very valid long-term
solution, but it's quick.
<p>
<b><li>permlevel</b><br>
The level of access of the user to the whole task list manager.  Allowed values are: 0 - inactive
user (in case I want to block somebody but not lose the contact info), 1 - viewer only, and 2 -
full access.  Full access just means that this user may own tasks and processes.  The detailed
privileges of a viewer-level user are granted with the keyword/permission system (in the next
section.)  Privileges of a level-2 user to processes owned by other people are likewise
governed by the permission system.
<p>
In the demo system, the "demo" user is a level-2 user.  This means that people trying out the
demo can create their own tasks and processes in order to see how the system works.  They also
have viewer-level access to the wftk processes.
<p>
<b><li>name, email, website</b><br>
Since this particular implementation is aimed at being a demo, these three contact information
fields seem logical.  Obviously anything could be tossed in here as contact info, and this UI
wouldn't care about it.
