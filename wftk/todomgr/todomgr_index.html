<h2>To-do manager</h2><hr>
This implementation of a to-do manager is heavily influenced by the
<a href="http://www.vivtek.com/wftk.html">open-source workflow toolkit</a> project,
and it's also growing out of my long-time need for a project task manager for dealing
with my customers' support requests.  The database schema used will thus be the same
required by the wftk engine, but the goal is an application that can stand alone without
workflow.
<p>
The platform I'm developing this version against is <a href="/aolserver.html">AOLserver/Tcl</a>
for a couple of reasons.  The most important of those reasons is simply that I'm pressed for
time due to a couple of illnesses (gotta love these Indiana springs) and I'm pretty good at
Tcl, so this is the quickest way to get this portion of the overall wftk system completed.
However, the platform, while not particularly portable, has a lot to recommend it.  If you're
not familiar with it, I encourage you to read up on it a little.
<p>
And just so I have all the related links out of the way right off the bat, I'm coding this
in a <a href="/litprog.html">literate programming style</a> using my very raw tool 
<a href="/lpml.html">LPML</a>.  Please feel free to give me any feedback you might have about
the formatting of the code, therefore, because that is also under development.
<p>
For the wftk folks following along, the fact that this prototype is being implemented in
AOLserver/Tcl in no way constrains your own implementation.  I want to hammer out the function
points and database schema without wasting too much time on languages I'm less familiar with,
but for the "release" version of the wftk (whatever that means), I'd like to have at least
a Perl/CGI implementation (for broad support) and possibly something in ASP as well.  I'm
sure most of you would like to see a Java servlet approach, but within the timeframe of this
initial project, I don't consider that likely.  (Now if anybody wants to <i>help</i>, that'll
be a different matter!)
<p>
Really, to fit into a wftk installation, the to-do manager must:
<ul>
<li>Work with the schema of the active process repository
<li>Know when to call the wftk engine to get things done (primarily at task completion), and
<li>Present the to-do list in any way necessary.
</ul>
And here's how I do it.
