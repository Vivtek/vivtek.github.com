The task list is wftk's <i>active process repository</i>.  It consists of two tables; one
defines projects, the other tasks.  My epiphany about the relationship of wftk to a general
task management tool came when I realized that tasks can exist without projects perfectly
well.
<p>
This schema works on PostgreSQL.  Nothing fancy, and I'm omitting DBA details like indexing
and the like; I just want to define the fields we'll need.  Let's call our tables "process"
and "task", yeah, those are fairly descriptive.  Translation of this schema to other SQL
dialects should be relatively straightforward, as most of the fields are just character data
anyway (one of the things I like about PostgreSQL is that I don't have to feel guilty
about text fields, or pretend that I can project meaningful size boundaries onto them.)
<p>
Besides the task and process tables, I'm including a user table, which will probably be 
replaced at some point with a more sophisticated directory mechanism, and a keyword table.
The keyword table started out as an organizational mechanism completely extraneous to wftk,
but I realized that it's also an excellent place to store permissions linking users with
classes of task and process.  I'm not sure how much overlap that will end up having with 
workflow proper, but that's the whole purpose of doing a prototype.  (I'm approaching this
with the attitude of "Plan to throw one away; you will anyway."  I surely wish I knew the
attribution for that quote, because it's a good one.)
<p>
So here are the tables we'll be defining, all in all:

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>create table process (
<i>See <a href="schema.html#process">Process table</a></i>
);

create table task (
<i>See <a href="schema.html#task">Task table</a></i>
);

create table user (
<i>See <a href="user_schema.html">Schema for user access</a></i>
);

create table keyword (
<i>See <a href="perm_schema.html#keyword">Keyword table</a></i>
);

create table permission (
<i>See <a href="perm_schema.html#permission">Permission table</a></i>
);

</pre></td></tr></table>

The schema I'm presenting here is meant to implement the necessary fields for wftk and those
for this to-do manager.  The nice thing about SQL, of course, is that properly written SQL
interface code can deal with views onto the data (so that you can tack other stuff onto whatever
table you like and things won't break.)  Don't feel overly constrained by these definitions.
(This is turning into my mantra: don't feel constrained by any of my coding decisions!)
<br><br>
<a name="process">
<i>Process table</i><br>
The process table will actually not be used very heavily for to-do management.  The only place
we care about this table will be in the overview, when we'll use it to group tasks by process
(or "project").  Nevertheless, this presentation is also an implementation of the wftk
active process repository, so let's take a look at what we'll need in there.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>id text,
owner text,
title text,
description text,
started timestamp,
parent_process text,
parent_task text,
definition text,
datasheet text,
status text

</pre></td></tr></table>

OK, let's run down the list and I'll tell you what each of those is for.
<ul>
<b><li> owner</b>: the user who owns the process.<br>
There are two basic ways that processes get created; either the wftk engine creates them when
a definition is activated, or a user creates a process manually using the to-do manager.  In
the latter case, the user's id is used as "owner"; in the former, we'll see what makes sense.
In some cases, it makes sense for the initiating user to be the owner, but if a process is
initiated anonymously (say, in response to an HTTP form submission) then the owner of the
process definition will probably be used.  We'll see what makes sense later.

<br>
<b><li> title, description</b>: short and long description of the project for reporting.<br>
For a manual process, these are obvious.  For a wftk-initiated process, they may be superfluous.
Again, only banging on a prototype will answer that question.  Certainly we'll need a title
in place in order for the to-do manager and other UI components to have something to display.
I certainly don't want to have to retrieve the definitions of all active processes in order
to create an activity report, for instance.

<br>
<b><li> started</b>: date the process was created.<br>
Enough said.  Obviously applies to both categories of process.

<br>
<b><li> parent_process, parent_task</b>: parent information.<br>
If this is a subprocess, then it might require different handling.  Certainly when it completes,
then its parent task must also be completed.  The task ID would logically be unique, but I
have a nasty habit of programming defensively.

<br>
<b><li> definition</b>: location (URL, presumably) of the process definition.<br>
This is only meaningful in the context of wftk, of course.  The process definition is used by
the wftk core engine to determine what comes next when a task is completed or rejected.

<br>
<b><li> datasheet</b>: location of the datasheet for the process.<br>
The datasheet module is of course a wftk module -- but could be used quite nicely independently
of wftk.  It's a place to stash data associated with a process.  (Note that the task also has
a datasheet location.  By default these locations will be identical.)

<br>
<b><li> status</b>: state of the process.<br>
I guess pending, active, completed, aborted would be logical states.  Anybody have any
suggestions?
</ul>

<br><br>
<a name="task">
<i>Task table</i><br>
The task table is similarly overloaded.  I think I'm getting somewhat carried away about
everything I want to attach to tasks, but this will do for a first run.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>id text,
process text,
status text,
owner text,
description text,
role text,
queue text,
created timestamp,
sched_date date,
sched_time time,
priority smallint,
complete timestamp,
datasheet text,
subprocess text

</pre></td></tr></table>

These are as follows.
<ul>
<b><li> process</b>: the ID of the process this task belongs to (if any).<br>
If the user has manually created a task with the to-do manager, then there needn't be any
process associated at all.  For manual tasks, the process is effectively nothing more than an
organizational mechanism (i.e. it's there for the description fields and to group on.)

<br>
<b><li> status</b>: the status of the task.<br>
Pending, active, complete, rejected, and request.  A
 "pending" task is one which has been added by the
wftk engine, but is either not yet assigned to a user or has simply not yet been activated.  If
I have a pending task already assigned to me, then I can see it in my to-do list, and can set
scheduling information for it.  I just can't actually complete it until it's active.  If the 
status is "request", this is a manually created task which another user has created for me.
I can either reject it or accept it; if accepted, the task becomes active.

<br>
<b><li> owner</b>: the user assigned to the task.<br>
In the case of a manually created task, this is the person who created the task.  If I create
a task for another user, that is really not a task, but a request -- the cleanest way to 
implement this would be to provide a new status "request".  Then the request would have to have
attached data to describe it, and that would require a datasheet module, but that's life in the
big city.  In the case of a task which has not yet been assigned, "owner" will be blank and
"role" and/or "queue" will be filled in instead.

<br>
<b><li> description</b>: a short description of the task.<br>
In the case of a manual entry, the user simply types in some description of the task.  For
wftk usage, the engine will create a description based on particulars of the task.

<br>
<b><li> role</b>: the process role associated with the task.<br>
This has meaning only in the wftk process; it's the role in the process definition which the
user will be fulfilling during this task.  The chief reason to have it here is to facilitate
reassignment should the task be rejected.

<br>
<b><li> queue</b>: the queue on which the task resides.<br>
For queueing of tasks and requests.  This is still rather inchoate but I just have the
intuition that I'm going to need it.  It's not used by wftk.

<br>
<b><li> created</b>: the date the task was created.<br>
Useful for implementing queues.  Not needed by wftk.

<br>
<b><li> sched_date, sched_time</b>: date and time of scheduled start.<br>
This is completely ignored by wftk.  It's used for reporting and for organization of the
individual's to-do lists.  Also makes it nice for representing appointments as tasks.

<br>
<b><li> priority</b><br>
This is where I'm not sure if I'm getting out of control with feeping creaturism.  I think that
this will be necessary, at least for implementation of priority queues, and also for individual
to-do list organization, but I'm not sure where the line should be drawn.

<br>
<b><li> completed</b>: date of completion.

<br>
<b><li> datasheet</b>: link into datasheet.<br>
This is the location where values associated with the task (or request) are stored.  This will
all make sense later, I promise.  Since this module isn't implemented yet, though, there's not
a lot of point in pontificating.

<br>
<b><li> subprocess</b>: subprocess ID.<br>
If this task is being implemented by a subprocess, then the ID of that subprocess is here.

</ul>
