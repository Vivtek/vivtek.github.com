This is an example definition of the process in the <a href=../usage/chair.html>chair
purchase scenario</a>.  Wish me luck.

So let's talk about this.  I pretty much just sat down and hacked this out, making up
syntax as I went.  Let's talk about the parts I made up, and the parts that I already had
planned.<ul>

<b><li>Variable interpolation</b><br>
You'll notice the syntax I used for using variable values: ${variable name}.  This is
borrowed from Tcl and Perl; I found that without assuming accessibility to variable values
I really couldn't even express this simple scenario.  So regardless of what other scripty
kinds of things we need to be able to do, we certainly need to be able to insert the
values of variables into strings.  I use this mostly in the text for alerts, but also for
the "to" value for alerts which go back to the requester.

<b><li>Role alert</b><br>
The alert type="role" is something which seemed natural.  Messages to role queues should
be handled, uh, well, not sure yet.  If a purchasing clerk has already been assigned, then
it's probably logical that that person would receive a role alert.  This is another area
where actual usage of the prototype system will help us make sense of things.

<b><li>Use of situation to break sequence</b><br>
To my surprise, the situation tag just seemed completely intuitive in the case shown here.
So maybe the situation concept is a good cover for exceptions.  I guess a couple more example
process definitions will shed light on that question.

<b><li>Exclusion of supplier from system</b><br>
When I originally drew the diagram in the original chair scenario, it seemed logical to
include the supplier in order to make the flow easier to see.  But when writing this
definition, it seemed illogical to include the supplier in the internal roles, as the supplier
will obviously be another company (and that seemed to be the reaction of the group to the
original diagram, too...)  At any rate, I had to include another task for Accounting in
order to make it all make sense.  So this definition doesn't quite correspond to the diagram.
Ah well.  We pick up the pieces and get on with life, right?

<b><li>Parallel block</b><br>
Note the use of a parallel block for the two tasks receiving something back from the
supplier (the chair and the invoice).  This parallelism reflects the fact that we <i>don't
know</i> what we'll get first.  So both tasks have to be active in order for them to be
fulfillable.  Since receipt of the chair is supposed to alert the requester, there's a
sequence nested within that block.  (If the alert simply followed the receipt task, then
the alert would fire as soon as the chair was ordered.  Which is not what we want.)

<b><li>Implicit situation?</b><br>
It would seem that if a task is rejected, that an implicit situation is generated which breaks
the chain of events.  I guess by saying that I'm also buying into the idea of exception-as-situation.
The question is, how should such a situation be named?  How should a handler be written,
given that a single handler would logically be written to handle rejection at any one of
several steps?  This question needs some more thought.  But the problem with handling
rejection as a situation is that we've got no way to get the process back on track should
the rejection be cleared up.  Messy.
</ul>

Anyway, I found this a pretty intuitive way to represent what I perceived to be the
original workflow.  Of course, most people using this system won't compose the XML by
hand, but if it's easy to represent a workflow with this setup, then tools will also be
relatively easy to write.

Onwards.
