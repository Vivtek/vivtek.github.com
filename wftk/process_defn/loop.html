The iteration construct is based on a presentation by Charles T. Zahn
in 1974, which Donald Knuth described in a paper in the same year and republished in
his book <i>Literate Programming</i> in 1992.  It's a very general loop structure which
covers "plain old" loops as well, so that we get a lot of freedom in building loops without
having to write much code to interpret them.
<p>
The whole thing is based on the <i>situation</i>.  The situation is basically a named
break, and after the loop you write handlers which process the situations generated.  This
avoids the common problem of, say, a for loop with a break -- when you exit the loop, you
commonly test the loop index to see whether it's within the bounds; if it is, you know the
loop exited via the break, and not by simply running through the whole range of the index.
This results in code that's hard to understand, sometimes.  But it gets worse when you have
two or more breaks.  Then you have you declare and set a flag to determine which break was
actually hit.
<p>
Well, this iteration construct pretty much does that for you.  Here's how it
works:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;sequence repeat&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;situation name="sit1"&gt;&lt;/situation&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/sequence&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;handle situation="sit1"&gt;...&lt;/handle&gt;<br>
</code>
First, notice that there is no special loop tag -- we don't need one.  We simply tack a
"repeat" qualifier onto a sequence or parallel tag, and that makes the block repeat until
a situation occurs.  The situation breaks out of the sequence, and is handled afterwards.
We know exactly what the situation is, by the name used.  We can have multiple
breaks and we know which one was invoked.  We don't need a declaration anywhere, and we're
not cluttering our value sheet up with values that are used only internally.
<p>
So all we need are the situation and handle tags:<br><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;situation name="name"&gt;...&lt;/situation&gt;<br></code>
The contents of a situation tag are parameters to be used by the handler.<br><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;handle situation="name"&gt;...&lt;/handle&gt;<br></code>
And the contents of the handle tag are of course the code blocks to be executed when that
situation applies.
<p>
The situation tag can be placed in a sequence or a parallel block.  If it's in a sequence,
it breaks immediately and no further sequential actions will be taken.  If in a parallel,
since all the actions are started simultaneously, we obviously can't stop processing things
that are already started; so all the
actions will run to completion, synchronize at the end of the block, and the block will
then terminate and the handler will be invoked.  Note that a non-repeating sequence can be
terminated with a situation perfectly naturally, but a non-repeating parallel block with a
situation will run in exactly the same way as one without a situation.  The only difference
is that you can use the situation as a flag, so that the appropriate handler will run.
<p>
If no handler is provided immediately following the block in which a situation occurs, then
the parent block is terminated with that situation, and so on until the situation does have
a handler.  This provides a neat solution to the problem of how to break nested loops.
<p>
Something else we'll need for loops is an index variable.  The index variable simply counts
the number of times we've been around the loop, and we can name it whatever we like.  The 
syntax for this is <code>&lt;sequence repeat index="i"&gt;</code>, which makes an index
variable named <i>i</i>.  This is a pretty lightweight substitute for a <i>for</i> loop,
but it should be enough.
<p>
Finally, I'm toying with the idea of providing nonbreaking situations.  These would be analogous
to flags and would provide a dandy way to flag completion of particular segments of a block.
Since parallelism will make it possible for multiple situations to be activated at once
anyway (thus making it necessary to maintain a list of situations active) I might as well
exploit that mechanism.  So <code>&lt;situation break=no&gt;</code> would signify that.
Handlers should then be logically invoked in reverse order of situation creation.  Thus the
creation of a situation pushes the situation onto a stack.
<p>
The objection will probably be raised that this design is too complicated.  However, it's
really easier than having separate for and while loops, for instance, because there is
less to parse and to keep track of.  And we really do need iteration to do nearly anything
outside of toy problems.  The inclusion of parameters with the situation is more complicated
than absolutely necessary, so the prototype probably won't have parameters on situations.
It may turn out to be more than we need anyway.  We'll see.

It's interesting that work like this, done in the early 70's, was completely ignored by
subsequent language development.  The problem was that Algol and Pascal had already been
developed.  C was based on those, leaving no particular motivation to look at new structures.
And then of course in the 80's, coming a little out of left field, object-oriented programming
was the leading movement, and the programming structures available to the programmer
actually <i>writing</i> the object methods was based on C, and again new constructs were
uninteresting.
<p>
Read Knuth's article for an interesting exploration of different ways of handling the goto
problem, especially in regards to loops.
<p>
<i>Addendum (2/23/00)</i><br>
As I was working on the <a href=ecomm_defn.html>e-commerce scenario</a> it became obvious that
this iteration construct was a little <i>too<i> simple, so I augmented it with two additional
modifiers: <code>foreach</code> denotes a pseudovariable which takes on all the values in
<code>values</code>, where <code>values</code> is a list construct.  This allows, for
instance, parallel iteration across rows of a query, which was what I needed for the e-commerce
scenario.  A simple numeric iteration was of no use to me there, and in fact I found that
<i>none</i> of my scenarios needed numeric iteration.  Go figure.
<p>
So the <code>values</code> modifier pretty much implies <code>repeat</code>, with the
consequence that when the iteration runs out of values, it stops without any condition
holding.  However, open-ended iteration (repeat without values) will come in handy, so the
<code>repeat</code> modifier will stay.
<p>
A <code>values</code> modifier without a <code>foreach</code> still makes sense, but there
is no way to refer to the current value.  You can also include both <code>foreach</code>
and <code>index</code> modifiers; the index will simply maintain a count of the values
used up so far.
