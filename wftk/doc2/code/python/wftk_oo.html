This is a set of Python classes for wftk.  It builds on the wrappers for the <a href="py_xmlapi.html">XMLAPI</a>,
the <a href="py_repmgr.html">repository manager</a>, and the <a href="py_wftk.html">wftk core API</a>.
Since Python is indentation-sensitive, and the LPML is indentation-challenged, if you change this source,
be sure not to break up indentation blocks without preserving indentation very carefully.
<p></p>
So.  Let's first output a handy comment block.

# This is a Python implementation of the wftk class schema.  It is the first such implementation.
#
# It's frustrating that my LPML tool can't do Python, due to its inability to preserve indentation.
# Maybe it's time to re-implement LPML....

Our importation needs are pretty minimal; we import our wrappers, and that's about it.  Note that the
wftk core wrapper isn't written yet, so we don't import it yet.  (See how this all makes sense?)

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>import repmgr
import xmlapi
from types import *
</pre></td></tr></table>

The "types" module provides a few handy utilities for talking about types when looking at data coming
in.  Actually, at the moment I don't think I'm using it.  I might take it back out at some point.
<p></p>

We define one error, <code>ParseError</code>, which I raise when a parse command results in a parse
error.  The details of the error get passed out of the wrapper, and we toss it right into the error
we raise.  Neat stuff.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>ParseError = "Error parsing XML"
</pre></td></tr></table>

The structure of the wftk class schema is pretty simple, and falls into two basic sections: 
low-level local data handling (XML and xmlobj classes) and higher-level system interaction
(starting at the repository class).
<p></p>
All data in the wftk is treated as XML data; this is manipulated using the XMLAPI library, which is
wrapped in the "xml" class:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre><i>See <a href="class_xml.html">xml: XMLAPI data structure</a></i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

Record-like data in the wftk is treated as a special case of XML, the "xmlobj", which defines
field access on top of the XMLAPI library.  The xmlobj class subclasses xml:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre><i>See <a href="class_xmlobj.html">xmlobj: XML-based record object</a></i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p></p>
System interaction begins with the <i>repository</i>, which represents a system.  The repository
organizes all its data into lists, each of which have entries.  Most action in a repository happens
at the entry level, since that's where the data is actually stored.  The entry has field values and
optionally can have attached files; when an entry is added, deleted, or changed then the system can
take arbitrary action, either via the publishing machinery (writing pages for later consumption on
a website) or via the workflow machinery (creating tasks, doing data manipulation, sending notification,
and so forth.)
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre><i>See <a href="class_repository.html">repository: the system</a></i>
<i>See <a href="class_list.html">list: a data source</a></i>
<i>See <a href="class_entry.html">entry: an individual list entry</a></i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p></p>

Likely further extensions to this class structure are as follows, but I'm feeling this out as I go.
<ul>
<b><li>Task</b>When I retrieve an entry from a list of tasks, the result is not just an entry,
it is a task.  Primarily this means that in addition to doing entry-specific things to it, I can also
complete it, rescind it, and so forth.<br>
<b><li>Process</b>I'm not yet sure that a process requires a separate object.  Each entry in
a list in the repository manager has workflow aspects, and is thus a process (the list in the repmgr
is actually an elaboration on the dsrep of the wftk core API).  So a process object may simply be
superfluous.<br>
<b><li>Query</b>Queries will certainly be required; a query is passed to the repmgr to return
selected ranges of objects.  This may be turned into SQL, or it may be used to search a directory,
or whatever is appropriate for the list adaptor used by the list in question.<br>
<b><li>Attachment</b>Attachments are document-sized, optionally versioned values in entries.
Document management, folks.<br>
<b><li>Procdef</b>It seems really logical to build procdef-specific manipulation into a
nice object, even though there aren't any procdef-specific API calls in the wftk yet.  This sort
of thought is why it's always nice to switch development languages and paradigms.<br>
</ul>
