The list object would almost appear to be a superfluity given the fact that the repmgr API really treats a list name and key as
nearly equivalent <i>coordinates</i> of an entry -- but lists are indeed somewhat privileged, and a useful function for the list
object to fulfill is that it can act as an iterator along a list or query.  I'm probably going to end up conflating the list and
query notions into a single list object -- this is because a list storage in the repository needn't necessarily be the only kind
of list we think of as a "list".  In short, a list should be thought of as <i>any</i> collection of entries, even if it's not
strictly a storage-oriented list defined by the repository.
<p></p>
In fact, a list could even be constructed dynamically and simply contain a bunch of otherwise unrelated entries or something.
We'll see what makes the most sense later.  This is fun.
