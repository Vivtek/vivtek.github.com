The wxPyWf is a set of handy-dandy classes to facilitate the building of quick wxPython GUI applications
using the tools in the wftk.  These roughly fall into two categories: those which simply use the XMLAPI
to do XML kinds of things (like menu and dialog definers), and those which use wxPython to present
truly workflow-specific things (like ... don't know yet.)

We import the wftk OO classes, and some wxPython stuff.

First and foremost of the wxPyWf classes is the XML-defined menu.  I'm departing from the norm in
my GUI design tools here, to a certain extent, in that menu events do not directly invoke a handling
procedure; rather, each menu event is used to construct a command, which is then handed off to a
command-line interface handler (a CLI object).  This has some awfully nice consequences: we can build
macros rather easily, we can log all actions taken by the user, and we can share a common CLI between
GUI and server-side code.
<p></p>
I'm not sure whether it will make sense for dialogs to work in the same way; I rather think that
a dialog will allow the construction of a repmgr list object instead.  That list object may then
be used to specify an action, but it may be used in some other way instead -- and of course it may
have absolutely arbitrarily complex structure.  The dialog generalizes rather well to the notion of
a wizard, so I think this is a solid way to go.

Anyway, each class defined in this package is on its own documentation page.  Follow any of the
