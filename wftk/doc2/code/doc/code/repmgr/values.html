<i>(Feb 16, 2002)</i>: Once I really started to get into working with objects, I realized a couple of motivations for list values,
chief of which is the ability to maintain versions of values.  Not least, however, is the fact that LDAP fields are <i>all</i> lists,
so it'll behoove us to be able to manage such records so that an LDAP storage adaptor won't have such a long row to hoe.
<p></p>
At any rate, I want to have a simple API which can deal with plain-vanilla fields as well as list-augmented ones, in the same manner.
A plain-vanilla field is a "field" element which has an "id" attribute naming the value, and whose content, in string form, is the
value of the field, or in a "value" attribute.  The new wrinkle on that is to posit a couple of extra attributes; the "curver" attribute
signals that the field is versioned, meaning that each child element of the field element is a version value with a key, and that the
curver attribute selects the currently valid value.  And the "defval" value does the same thing, except with the understanding that
<i>all</i> the values are currently valid, but that one of them is a default value.  A logical combination of the two modes would be
to posit version sets -- but I'm not going to mess with the idea of versioned lists, thank you very much.
