<hr>

The <a href="index.html">repository manager</a> is the data handling portion of the wftk open-source workflow toolkit.
It organizes <i>objects</i> (sometimes I call them <i>entries</i>) into <i>lists</i>.  Such a collection of lists is
called a <i>repository</i>.  An additional feature of a repository is that it may have a Web view; the layout of this
site is the other half of the repository manager's functionality.  Pages are organized into a site map, and publishing
links are established between lists and pages; when data is changes, static pages can be written to the Website, and
those pages can be served up very quickly and easily.
<p></p>
All this functionality works rather well behind the scenes with the repmgr's command-line interface, but when it comes
to adding and editing data, the command-line interface offers no particularly good solution, unless you genuinely
enjoy typing long XML object files without any backspace.  So this CGI interface is a logical next step in the evolution
of the repository manager.
<p></p>
Since the repmgr already has a lot of HTML-formatting functionality built in, the CGI interface is designed to be
integrated right into the Website it manages.  This means that pages can be formatted in the same way as the overall site
with no need to duplicate the formatting work between different systems.  Moreover, since the repmgr is integrated with
the overall wftk workflow system, it is very easy to set up a system to allow anonymous users (or non-anonymous users) to
submit entries to lists, subject to an approval process involving responsible administrators.  This is a powerful feature,
and a quick-and-easy CGI interface to it means you can set up interactive Websites very easily.  (Caveat: this is still
alpha-quality software.  So by "very easily" I may well mean something you don't find very easy.  Give it some time, though,
and it <i>will</i> be very easy.)
<p></p>
The CGI interface needn't provide the same level of functionality as the command-line interface.  At first, all I really
want to do is to provide facilities to display blank forms and add new objects, display edit forms and modify existing
objects, list objects, and delete objects.  And even listing objects will be the second phase of development -- the minimal
level of functionality will rely on a functioning display Website to provide navigation for the editing scripts.
<p></p>
So.  Down to business.  First order of the day is to include our repmgr and CGI functionality, and get the CGI environment.
I'm using my <a href="../xmlapi/xmlcgi.html">XMLCGI interface</a> to collect CGI environment information;
what a blast from the past!  I haven't looked at it for
two years or so, since I wrote it to support the prototype procdef editor.  (Note that the procdef editor will soon be revived,
based on the repository management functionality now finally working.)  This framework below can be seen as the canonical
framework for any CGI program.
In the spirit of coming up with a universal template, I'm trying to build it as generally as possible.
<table width=100%>

</pre></td></tr></table>
<br><br>
<a name="globals">
<i>Global variable definitions</i><br>
Here are the global variables used by the rest of the program.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>FILE * file;
XML * repos = NULL;
XML * list;
XML * layout;
XML * form;
XML * defn;
XML * obj;
XML * mark;
const char * username;
const char * mode;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br><br>
<a name="openrepos">
<i>Opening the repository definition</i><br>
The first order of business is of course to open the repository definition so that we can do everything else in the context of the
repository.  This is much simpler than in the case of the command-line interface, because there's no particularly nice way to pass
in command-line flags to a CGI flag.  So we just open the current directory's copy of site.opm.  No muss, no fuss.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>file = fopen ("site.opm", "r");
if (!file) {
   return handle_error ("No site definition file was found.  Please notify the site administrator.");
}
repos = xml_read (file);
if (!repos) {
   return handle_error ("The site definition file is corrupt.  Please notify the site administrator.");
}
repos_open (repos, NULL);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br><br>
<a name="userauth">
<i>Authenticating the user</i><br>
This is going to be to-do for a little while.  The repository manager library doesn't yet really have user-auth functions, and
it'd be silly to implement it twice.  Naturally, the wftk core has the user adaptor class, but I haven't looked at it in repmgr yet.
<p></p>
The first level of authentication will be a browser-level authentication; soon after that, however, I'll look at creating user
sessions in the repository, which will be indexed via cookie.  Then we can store authentication information in the session and skip
the browser authentication dialog, which typically confuses most naive users a great deal.
<p></p>
The zeroth level of authentication will simply be to leave it to the webserver; in this case we can just look at the auth information
coming in in the CGI headers.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>username = xml_attrval (env, "REMOTE_USER");
list = repos_defn (repos, "_users");
if (list) {
   /* Here's where we'll do repmgr-local user authentication. TODO: do it. */
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br><br>
<a name="process">
<i>Figuring out what to do</i><br>
Before we can do anything, we have to figure out what it is we want to do.  This is governed by the "mode" variable.  The default
mode is probably going to be "list" -- but since the list handler is going to be in the second phase, we'll just not do a whole
lot in the absence of a mode.
<p></p>
Useful modes (actions) will be as follows.  In general, GET will be used for retrieval of information, and POST will be used wherever
a change to data is being proposed.  This allows a blanket user authentication to be imposed by the webserver itself in simple
installations, and lets us gain some control over our data even if we haven't implemented any user authentication in the repository
itself.  These modes are roughly in order of priority of development.
<p></p>

<table>
<tr><td><b>Mode</b></td><td><b>Meth</td></td><td><b>Action</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>new</td><td>GET</td><td>Presents blank HTML form for adding an object</td></tr>
<tr><td>add</td><td>POST</td><td>Adds an object from said blank form</td></tr>
<tr><td>edit</td><td>GET</td><td>Presents a filled HTML form for editing an object</td></tr>
<tr><td>copy</td><td>GET</td><td>Presents a filled HTML form for copying an object</td></tr>
<tr><td>mod</td><td>POST</td><td>Edits an existing object using form input</td></tr>
<tr><td>del</td><td>POST</td><td>Deletes an object</td></tr>
<tr><td>list</td><td>GET</td><td>Lists keys from a given list</td></tr>
<tr><td>info</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets installation information or a set editor home page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>attach</td><td>POST</td><td>Uploads file attachment</td></tr>
<tr><td>retrieve</td><td>GET</td><td>Downloads file attachment</td></tr>
<tr><td>checkout</td><td>POST?</td><td>Downloads for modification (i.e. locks the attachment)</td></tr>
<tr><td>search?</td><td>GET</td><td>Search objects -- I've got some pretty detailed plans for searching</td></tr>
</table>

And I suppose we'll take it further from there.  It's pretty obvious that the document-management aspects of the CGI interface will
be pretty exciting stuff.

When adding, we're processing an HTTP POST, meaning that our data is on stdin.  After adding, we want to return a page which makes
sense -- probably the processed added object makes the most sense, working on the assumption that the CGI interface is integrated with
the published site.

<a name="todo">
<i>Taking it further</i><br>
There is plenty of stuff that the CGI interface (or any interface) should do to make the repository manager a really powerful tool.
Please feel free to <a href="mailto:wftk@vivtek.com">suggest some features</a>.  As I get more ideas, I'll include them here.
The current rough to-do list is in something like this order:
<ul>
<li>Repmgr-based user authentication using _user list.  (Note that this list serves as an interface for the user adaptor, so that
plugging OpenLDAP in will be a fairly high priority.)
<li>Session-based authentication using _sessions list.
<li>"List" and "info" modes.
<li>Document management facilities.  Having a useful interface will also make it easier for me to further develop said facilities.
</ul>
<p></p>
Note that ports of the CGI interface to other environments are not the same as features, but they are interesting ideas for further
development.  Some Web environments which should be supported will be: AOLserver, Zope, PHP, Perl/CGI using "use Workflow;", and
so forth.
