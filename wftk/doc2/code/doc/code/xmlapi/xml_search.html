<i>(September 24, 2001)</i>: This is the final bit that I implemented quickly in Perl and which I've needed for a while in C.  It's
probably not the last thing I'll ever add to the API, but it's close.
<p></p>
A search is simple: you supply a tree to search, an (optional) element name, and an (optional) attribute and value.  The value is a
format if the searchf variant is used.  Standard C stuff, really.  If you don't give an element name, any element matches; otherwise,
only that element is searched for.  If you give an attribute name, only elements with that attribute will match; if you don't supply
a value, then any nonzero value will match.
<p></p>
If you don't supply element or attribute, you have a way to visit every node in the tree in depth-first order.
<p></p>
The search can continue at the point you left off, if you use search_next or searchf_next and supply the last result as the point to
start.
<p></p>
My first attempt at search and search_next used them in mutual recursion, but I soon realized that that approach would grow the stack
to be as large as the entire XML tree.  Not very scalable...  So I switched to iteration and basically duplicated the code in both.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XMLAPI XML * xml_search (XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * value)
{
   int found = 0;
   XML * cur = start;
   XML * next;

   if (!xml_is_element (start)) return NULL;

   while (!found) {
      found = 1;
      if (element) {
         if (!xml_is (cur, element)) found = 0;
      }
      if (found &amp;&amp; attr) {
         if (value) {
            if (strcmp (value, xml_attrval (cur, attr))) found = 0;
         }
         else if (!*xml_attrval (cur, attr)) found = 0;
      }

      if (found) return cur;

      next = xml_firstelem (cur);
      while (!next) {
         if (!next) next = xml_nextelem (cur);
         if (!next) {
            if (cur == start || !cur) return NULL;
            cur = xml_parent (cur);
         }
      }

      cur = next;
   }
}
XMLAPI XML * xml_searchf (XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * format, ...);
XMLAPI XML * xml_search_next (XML * top, XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * value)
{
   int found = 0;
   XML * cur = start;
   XML * next;

   if (!xml_is_element (start)) return NULL;

   while (!found) {
      next = xml_firstelem (cur);
      while (!next) {
         if (!next) next = xml_nextelem (cur);
         if (!next) {
            if (cur == top || !cur) return NULL;
            cur = xml_parent (cur);
         }
      }

      cur = next;

      found = 1;
      if (element) {
         if (!xml_is (cur, element)) found = 0;
      }
      if (found &amp;&amp; attr) {
         if (value) {
            if (strcmp (value, xml_attrval (cur, attr))) found = 0;
         }
         else if (!*xml_attrval (cur, attr)) found = 0;
      }

      if (found) return cur;
   }
}
XMLAPI XML * xml_searchf_next (XML * top, XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * format, ...);
</pre></td></tr></table>

Of course, I don't actually need the searchf variant yet.  So I'll implement it later...  I hope.
