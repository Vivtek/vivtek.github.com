<h2>XML template library</h2>
<hr>
This set of routines are used for taking XML structures and expressing them as (say) HTML.  Thus the
XML template library is kind of like a very lightweight XSLT.  You may ask why I'm reinventing the
wheel here -- the answer is that I just plain like to reinvent wheels, and I've been thinking about
template processing since long before I ever heard of XSLT.  Besides, I'm of the (only mildly informed)
opinion that the XSL standard is just too big and complex really to be useful.  Maybe later I'll have
the time to sit down and digest it, but right now I have work to do.
<p></p>
And I do it with the XML template library!
