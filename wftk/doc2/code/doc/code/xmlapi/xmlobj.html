<h2>xmlobj: XML object storage</h2>
<hr>
This set of routines is logically somewhat separate from the XMLAPI itself, as it implements an
object storage system (with fields, links, and what-not) on top of the XMLAPI, using it as a handy
internal storage format which has its own serialization mechanism built in.
<p></p>
The xmlobj library started out as part of the <a href="../repmgr/index.html">repository manager</a>
section of the wftk, but upon closer examination it became fairly clear that wftk-only applications
could benefit from this code without needing full-fledge repository management.  So I pulled it
over here.
<p></p>
The upshot of the object storage format is simple: the XML object is taken to contain some mixture of
arbitrary XML along with "field" elements.  The field elements are primarily what xmlobj works with:
it finds them using an "id" attribute, and manipulates their values.  The basic field structure stores
its value as the field element's content.  Further refinement is possible: a field may contain a list
of values, for instance, or a set of value versions.  The field may have a type or format.  Links are
also supported (more later on that).  A class definition object may also be passed in, and will
determine visibility of fields, default values for missing fields, and so on.
<p></p>
The key: any XML not understood by the xmlobj library is <i>completely ignored</i>, which makes it
simple to store arbitrary information in such a record.  This is the new model for the wftk datasheet,
which rationalizes a lot of the flailing around in earlier wftk versions.
<p></p>
<i>May 4, 2002:</i> Which is all fine and well, but most people don't use XML this way.  So instead, I've
decided to augment the search capability of the field retrieval mechanism; if a field is named, say, "address",
then the retriever will work equally well with &lt;field id="address"&gt;1029 S. 15th Street&lt;/field&gt; <i>or</i>
with &lt;address&gt;1029 S. 15 Street&lt;/address&gt; -- much more reasonable.  To set a value which is an
element, I extend the API with an xmlobj_set_elem function.  xmlobj_set will still create a field element, but
it will happily set the value of an element field if it finds one.
<p></p>
The really nice thing about this extension is that we can think about convenient dotted naming for more complex
values: the name "address.line[0]" can refer to an xml_loc-like array arrangement, and so on.  I think this is going
to be extremely convenient to use.
