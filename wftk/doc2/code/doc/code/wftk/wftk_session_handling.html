<hr>
Up until now (March 2002) the session has been a binary struct which was passed along into all wftk API functions as a void
pointer.  I thought that was pretty slick -- but when I started in on the "../repmgr/index.html" repository manager, I realized
that it was a real pain.  For the repository manager, I already have to pass the repository definition around; passing a binary
session around, too, would make my API look like something Microsoft wrote.  (No offense to the Microsoft crowd.)  The obvious
answer, now that the XMLAPI includes a binary pointer for each XML element, would be to pass an arbitrary XML structure around
with all necessary binary information attached.  So ... that's what I'm doing here.
<p></p>
It's a little more complicated than that, however -- the repository manager occasionally needs that binary pointer itself on the
repository definition, so we can't use that one for our wftk session.  Instead, if the XML we get is a wftk-session element, we
assume that its binary pointer should be our session struct.  Otherwise, we do an xml_search for the first wftk-session element
we find, and use that.  If we don't have a wftk-session element, by God we make one and append it to the XML we're given.  Thus we
have a simple way to stash wftk information for whatever arbitrary XML structure is tossed at us as a context.
<p></p>
A caveat: the wftk API was originally intended to work fine if you gave it a NULL session.  I've never tested it that way, though,
because frankly it's not very flexible that way, which is why I came up with the session in the first place.
If anybody's interested in a micro-wftk or something that would minimize its
code and memory footprint, that might be a path to pursue.  Dunno.  I'm not interested in it at the moment.
<p></p>
To augment the wftk_session_alloc that comes up with a new session from thin air (and which, of course, simply allocated a session
struct earlier) we have a wftk_session_init, which takes an XML structure and enchants it.  It also returns a pointer to the
binary session struct, so it can be used internally for handy-dandy retrieval of the good stuff.  This shouldn't be necessary
from the outside.  But it <i>does</i> mean that an arbitrary XML structure can be used for wftk context without any previous
initialization, if we don't want to mess with it.
<p></p>
The old wftk_session_free can now go away, as it will happen automagically when xml_free is called on the context.  That's convenience!
<p></p>
I've included a "wftk_session_cleanup" which will remove the session binary (and if there's an extra wftk-session holder, that, too)
from an XML structure.  I don't know whether I'll ever use it, but it can't hurt and I'm on a roll.
<p></p>
<i>November 26, 2002</i>: Today I realized that this is the obvious place to stash context information.
So (in support of the repmgr context API) here it is.

The rest of the session API is pretty much just like the old version, except that it goes through wftk_session_init above to retrieve
the binary session information (as much as it needs, anyway.)
<p></p>
The session was originally supposed to hold just the currently used datasheet and procdef, to simplify freeing them up and to avoid
loading them again and again.  But then I realized it's also the only logical place to store the configuration.  So without a session,
you can't have a configuration and you're thrown onto the precompiled values for repository directories and such.  Of course, now the
configuration information is going to be stored in the enclosing context (probably) so this may not even make sense.  I guess we'll
sound it out as we go.

The <code>wftk_session_current</code> call associates a workflow object (in XML format) with the current session so that
subsequent calls to the library needn't look the object up again.  Ideally this should be transparent.  That makes freeing
up these objects somewhat confusing -- if you're not using a session, you have to do it yourself; otherwise, the session will
track things for you.  This stuff may get replaced at some point, it's hard to say.  It's been going strong for a year now.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT void wftk_session_current (XML * session, XML * object)

   WFTK_SESSION * sess = wftk_session_init (session);

   if (!sess) return;
   if (!object) return;

   if (xml_is (object, "datasheet")) {
      sess->datasheet = object;
      return;
   }
   if (xml_is (object, "procdef")) {
      sess->procdef = object;
      return;
   }

The cache mechanism is kind of weird.  You build an XML element and set a couple of attributes.  This element is now a cache key.
Toss it at the cache, and it will either match completely, in which case the key is discarded and the cached XML is returned, or
it won't, in which case the key is cached as a new structure and you can do with it what you will.  This is probably a dangerous
way of doing things, because if you have a wftk daemon running you've got no good way to clean up the cache or time things out or
really do anything.  So (yet again) this would be a good place to start looking post-v1.0 for things to do.  Sigh.  I can tell that
workflow is going to take the rest of my life.
<p></p>
The <code>wftk_session_cachecheck</code> function (get it?) checks for the key but doesn't delete it or cache it, either way.  This
is used to determine whether we're going to need to read something from the filesystem or not.  (In that case, if read, the parser
will return a brand-new XML structure, so it wouldn't be the same one as the key which got cached.  Not practical.)

The <code>wftk_session_setuser</code> creates a user structure and assigns the given userid to it.  More will certainly
be done with this later.  This function is not intended to include authentication of the userid.  The <code>wftk_session_getuser</code>
just returns the user structure with no further ado.  Of course, the caller may then change said structure (providing a
way to do that authentication.)

The <code>wftk_session_setcontext</code> takes a context object and places it in the current session,
freeing any previously stored context if necessary.  The <code>wftk_session_getcontext</code> then
simply retrieves a pointer to that context.  A NULL context may be passed.

<i>(April 11, 2001)</i> Stashing values in the session is just about the only logical way to handle alternate datastores.
The way this works is that the session is given a (character pointer) value to stash.  It wraps a value XML around that,
thereby copying the value, and tucks that away for later freeing.  Then it returns the value XML.
<p></p>

Later, the calling application has the option of freeing up the value for performance's sake (or leaving it there for
cleanup with the session for simplicity's sake.)  We do that by scanning the values <i>by pointer</i> and deleting the
one found (if found).  If we don't find the pointer, we do nothing.  This is C the way it should be (YMMV).

That's it for session handling.  Onwards to configuration management.
