<hr>
When I originally starting building a configuration module, I envisioned a more interchangeable 
module -- Unix configuration is generally compiled in or read from a .conf file somewhere, while
Windows configuration is usually retrieved from the Registry.  But then I started putting all the
configuration information into an XML file, and probably it'll stay there.  I guess you could
still do something else with it, but (like so many aspects of the wftk) this way works.
<p></p>
The only remaining drawback is that for statically compiled adaptors, the config module needs
to be recompiled.  That's inconvenient.  I'm not yet sure what the answer is, either; it'll
have something to do with the repository manager and lists of compiled modules, but that's
as far as I've thought it through.
<p></p>
And speaking of linking, one of the things we need to do is to keep track of what we've already
loaded dynamically.  To do that, let's define some linked-list things before we get serious
about configuration stuff.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>struct loaded_library {
   int adaptor_class;
   char adaptor[32]; /* Note the limit on adaptor name.  Since typical names are "localxml" or "oracle"
                        this limit should be quite sufficient. */
   char filename[256]; /* Here we'll build the path to the DLL. */
#ifdef WINDOWS
   HINSTANCE inst; /* This is how we'll do it under Win32.  Under Unix, I still have to learn how... */
#endif
   struct wftk_adaptor_info * ai;
   struct loaded_library * next;
};
struct loaded_library * loaded_libraries = NULL;
</pre></td></tr></table>
Now, I'm tempted to put this into the session, so it can be cleaned up when the session unloads.  But
really I think it's session-independent.  This leaves me a little confused as to when it <i>should</i>
be cleaned up.  Oh, what a tangled web we weave.
<p></p>
I think the best way to handle this is to create a cleanup function which can be called when the
wftk DLL is unloaded.  If the wftk is statically linked, then we can either call this explicitly, or
we can trust the OS to clean up properly for us when our process is terminated.  Does that make sense?
<p></p>
Let's go ahead and define our cleanup:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>void wftk_config_cleanup ()
{
   struct loaded_library * ll;

   while (loaded_libraries) {
      ll = loaded_libraries;
      loaded_libraries = ll->next;
#ifdef WINDOWS
      FreeLibrary (ll->inst);
#endif
      free (ll);
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

On that note, let's look at the <code>wftk_config_get_adaptor</code> function.
Note a couple of things about this function.  First, if the adaptor descriptor is a null pointer,
that means that the config module should use the system default, and that default must be statically
linked at the moment.  (Later I'll work out how to signify a default DLL in the config structure.)
<p></p>
To make the declarations of statically linked adaptors come out right, we need to declare a few functions
for each right here.  So to configure this config module with a new statically linked adaptor, all you
need to do is to declare the functions here, and then add the adaptor into the <code>switch</code> statement
below, and of course link the adaptor to the core engine at link time.

<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre></pre></td></tr></table>

And now the function itself.

And we need a very similar function in order to return adaptor lists.  Note that for adaptor lists, we don't bother with
all the adaptor classes, because many of them don't even make sense used that way.  Adaptor lists are only used for
notification-like functions (task index, debug messager, etc.)

   const char * mark;
   char * mark2;
   char adaptorbuffer[256]; /* TODO: another dang static buffer.  Fix it. */
   WFTK_ADAPTORLIST * list;

   }

   /* First pass: count semicolons, so we know how large a list structure to allocate. */
   mark = spec;

OK, with that out of the way, let's look at a simple function to return named values.
Since these named values will be constant, I'm going to take the cheap way out and just return pointers.  This means that
if the pointer is used to write, the workflow system is not going to react in a happy, friendly way, but it's so much
simpler to work with this way.
<p></p>
Some of the named values we use will be required only by specific adaptors, so I don't think it makes sense simply to
number them.  So instead of a nice clean <code>switch</code> we need a bunch of string comparisons.  Sorry.  The smarter
config module will presumably just pass this off to some API (the canonical one being the Windows Registry, of course.)
<p></p>
This function itself uses the definitions in the localdefs.h file.  That seems weird -- why not just include the values
right here? -- but it's more natural to look for config values in a .h file than in a .c file, so I think that makes more
sense for the time being.  At any rate, with any luck that's going to be superseded relatively quickly anyway.  Right?
<p></p>
And wow -- I superseded it before I even finished the release.  It was just too stupid.  The compiled values will still
be there as fallbacks in case you want to run <i>sans</i> config.xml, but we'll go ahead and read config.xml.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>static XML * config_find_option (XML * xml, const char * name) {
   int len;
   XML * x;
   char * mark = strchr (name, '.');

   if (mark) len = mark - name;
   else      len = strlen (name);

   x = xml_firstelem (xml);
   while (x) {
      if (!strncmp (xml_attrval (x, "name"), name, len) ||
          !strncmp (xml_attrval (x, "id"), name, len)   ||
          !strncmp ("?", name, len)) {
         if (mark) {
            return (config_find_option (x, mark + 1));
         }
         return (x);
      }
      x = xml_nextelem (x);
   }
   return NULL;

Was that too weird?  I'm sure it'll make sense later.

Finally, the debugging message handler.  In this first version, I'm going to get dumb (duh) and simply write to stdout.
Later we can refine this, with debug logging and stuff.  And later still we can get fancy.
