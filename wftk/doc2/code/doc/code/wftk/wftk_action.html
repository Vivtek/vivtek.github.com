Actions encapsulate both scripts and anything which requires permissions to be done.  Logically I'll want some way of
suppressing permissions calculations on scripts, but I'm not sure how best to do that.  It could be that the adaptor
itself would say, "I'm a scripting adaptor, don't check permissions."  All in all, this is a sticky wicket given the
availability of ad-hoc workflow; you don't want just any schmuck running ad-hoc workflow with malicious scripts
embedded, which are then run just because they're embedded scripts.  So I really don't know how to approach security yet.
If you're reading this, and you have a good idea, please <a href="mailto:wftk@vivtek.com">feel free to tell me</a>.
