Getting process status is simple; setting it may involve activation of potential task branches.  I'm still not sure about
this.

<i>22 June 2002</i>: Sure enough, my intuition was correct (or so it seems at the moment) -- when I set the status, that is equivalent
to describing a state transition.  So when I do this, I need to check all state-related workflows attached to the process and see
what transitions are available from the new state.  If any such transitions are found, and if they specify the explicit creation of
tasks, then we queue those tasks.

<p></p> There is, however, an additional can of worms associated with state transitions: that is simply the fact that if there are explicit
transitions already created for the state we're leaving, then those tasks must be rescinded.  So far, so good.  But then there's more.
Among the specifications for a state transition is the notion that a procdef can be required for approval before the transition takes
effect.  If such a workflow is already underway when another request for a state transition comes in, what should happen?  It seems
obvious to me that the active workflow should be deactivated.  Unfortunately we have no particular mechanism for the deactivation of a
workflow.  So for now, the simple way out is just not to deactivate this active workflow.  TODO: revisit this sometime next year or
something.

<p></p> Upon activation, though, there is also an "after" procdef allowed.  This can be seen as a notification process to tell people that
this transition has fired.  Note that there may also be an "on" procdef attached to the ending state.  This, however, can note only that
a particular state was reached, and has no information about which specific transition occurred (i.e. from which state we have
transitioned.)

<p></p>
The complete specification of a state transition is as follows:
<pre>
&lt;state id="state1"&gt;
  &lt;to id="state2" mode="potential|auto|task" role="..." user="..." label="..." before="..." after="..."/&gt;
  &lt;on procdef="..."/&gt;
&lt;/state&gt;
</pre>

The default mode is "potential".  Mode "task" means that an explicit (ad-hoc) task is created and indexed to represent the transition;
in this case, the role, user, and label attributes are used to specify that task.  Mode "auto" causes the transition to be made
immediately upon entry to the state.  The "before" and "after" attributes are used to specify procdefs in a procdef repository to be
activated against the process; the "before" procdef will serve as an approval process for the transition, while
the "after" will be activated when the transition actually is made.  As mentioned above, the "on" procdef is activated whenever the
state is entered.
