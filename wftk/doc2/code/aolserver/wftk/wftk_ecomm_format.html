There are basically three types of format I use in various contexts.  The first, and simplest, are
what I call "flat-string" templates, which format xmlobj objects.  The second, and hairiest, are
XML templates which operate on lists and records and are used in publishing of pages, but I don't like
them all that much, although their very flexible structure lets me do some sophisticated things.
The third, and oldest, I've used in AOLserver page generation for eight years,
and substitute tags formatted like [&#35;#this##] for named values, either in Tcl arrays or (in this
case) in ns_set objects.  I like this style a lot, so I've chosen to use it in this system.  It doesn't
let you do much in the way of structure, but usually that doesn't matter.

<p></p>
Anyway, note that the structure inherently allows you to nest tags as long as you like.  Kind of
convenient in theory, though I can't actually recall any time I used it.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>proc wftk_ecomm_format {format fields {format_function ""} {format_function_args [list]}} {
   set hit [regexp -nocase {\[&#35;#([-a-z_ 0-9.!/?]*)##\]} $format match tag]
   while {$hit} {
      set tag [string tolower $tag]
      set value [ns_set iget $fields $tag]
      if {$value == "" &amp;&amp; $format_function != ""} {
         set value [eval $format_function $tag $fields $format_function_args]
         ns_set update $fields $tag $value
      }

      regsub -all -nocase \\\[&#35;#$tag##\\\] $format [wftk_ecomm_format_fixup $value] format
      set hit [regexp -nocase {\[&#35;#([-a-z_ 0-9.!/?]*)##\]} $format match tag]
   }

   return $format
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

A nasty aspect of Tcl's regsub command is that ampersands in the replacement text are themselves replaced
by the text the replacement text is replacing.  (Parse it slowly; I think it works.)  This is highly
inconvenient when we don't know whether the replacement text may contain ampersands already, so here's
a little escaping function to fix them up.  Note the creative escaping you have to do...  It took me a
full day in 1996 to figure this out and I've copied it around ever since.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>proc wftk_ecomm_format_fixup {str} {
   regsub -all "&amp;" $str \\\\\\&amp; retval
   return $retval
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

A variant on formatting, of course, is the ability to take an HTML form and cram values into it.  Due to
the infinite wisdom of the original creators of HTML, this is a complete and utter shambles, as there are
no less than three completely separate mechanisms for indicating value (value= for fields, checked for
radio buttons and checkboxes, and selected for dropdowns, which aren't even regular input fields to start
with -- thanks, people!)  The following little function is useful for this kind of thing, and works from
the same stuff as wftk_ecomm_format.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>proc wftk_ecomm_populate_form {format fields {format_function ""} {format_function_args [list]}} {
   set done ""

   set index [string first &lt; $format]

   while {$index > -1} {
      append done [string range $format 0 $index]<
      incr index
      set format [string range $format $index end]

      if [string match input* $format] {
         
      } elseif [string match select* format] {

      }

      set index [string first &lt; $format]
   }

   return $done$format
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
