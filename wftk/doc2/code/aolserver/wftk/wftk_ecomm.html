Way back in 1997 and 1998, I wrote an e-commerce platform, with a shopping cart and
administrative facilities (the latter never really finished) and we ran some customer
catalogs on it for a while, but due to my utter lack of marketing acumen, it never
really took off.  But I still have some people using it, and frankly, from a
performance standpoint it's horrible, since it runs on Illustra, a database you
have never heard of.  (And if you have, then you know what I mean about performance.)
Back in 1997 it was pretty slick.  In 2003 it is not.
<p></p>
So I need to replace it, and as there is <i>still</i> no particularly widespread
open-source shopping cart that I know of, well, it's a golden opportunity to force
the wftk into another box and thereby make it grow.
<p></p>
My first cut of the ecomm application is going to be somewhat simplified, but
with luck I'll move into more complexity soon.
<p></p>
Also, the first cut is probably going to be pretty hardcoded.  The ultimate
goal is of course to produce a set of general e-commerce tools for the toolkit
which will work under any platform, but I'm under a time constraint for the
first go-around, so I don't know how much of that I'm going to be able to manage.
Anyway -- down to business.

<h2>Overall organization of an e-commerce system</h2>
An electronic commerce application essentially consists of three parts.  First,
there are a series of <i>catalog pages</i> describing goods and products which can be
purchased.  These pages are just like any website, so there is no mystery in building them,
just a lot of detail work.  The catalog may be hosted anywhere on the Internet;
it needn't be on the same server as the other components (and for scalability and
responsiveness there may be plenty of reasons to host things separately.)
<p></p>
The catalog pages contain forms which post to a second component, the <i>shopping
cart</i>.  The shopping cart builds an open order containing one or more line items,
collects customer, payment, and shipping information, calculates prices, shipping,
and tax costs, and sends orders to the owner of the site (the merchant.)
<p></p>
The third part of the system is the <i>order fulfillment system</i>, which lists
active orders, tracks line items which have already been shipped, notifies people
of what's going on, and provides a point for customers, merchants, and suppliers
to view all this information.  The order fulfillment system is a general workflow
application.
<p></p>
This application, the wftk_ecomm application, implements the second of those
three components.  The other two are essentially generic applications of the repository
manager, which, yes, means that in February 2003 they are still in large part vaporware,
but they'll be present eventually.  One installation of the wftk_ecomm application
can serve multiple merchants.  The first thing our code has to do is to find out
what merchants are served by the installation, and define the appropriate URLs
for each.  It does this by
reading the subdirectories of a given directory.  To change it, you need to change
the code, I guess.  I keep mine in /usr/local/AOLserver/ecomm.  Each subdirectory
of this directory is going to define a repository for the merchant in question.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>nsv_set wftk_ecomm basedir /usr/local/AOLserver/ecomm
nsv_set wftk_ecomm hostname https://www.vivtek.com
cd [nsv_get wftk_ecomm basedir]
foreach merchant [glob *] {
   nsv_set wftk_ecomm order_url($merchant) /$merchant/order
   ns_register_proc POST /$merchant/order wftk_ecomm_order $merchant
   ns_register_proc GET  /$merchant/order wftk_ecomm_order $merchant
   ns_register_proc POST /$merchant/add-order wftk_ecomm_addorder $merchant
   ns_register_proc GET  /$merchant/add-order wftk_ecomm_addorder $merchant
   ns_register_proc POST /$merchant/submit wftk_ecomm_submit $merchant
   ns_register_proc GET  /$merchant/submit wftk_ecomm_submit $merchant
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

Each merchant has the following URLs, then:
<ul>
<b><li>add-order</b> is posted from the catalog pages, and adds one or more line items to the
current order.  It must find the current order or create one if none is found, modify it,
recalculate price totals, and then redirect the customer's browser either to the order display
or back to the page they just came from, which will presumably contain a box of some kind
to display an overview of the current shopping cart.
<b><li>order</b> shows the current shopping cart in detail, and allows the customer to enter
personal information, choose a payment instrument, change or cancel quantities, and of course
finalize and submit the order.  (A lot of this is glossed over at the moment.)
<b><li>submit</b> checks the order for consistency and goes through wizard-form questions
that have not yet been answered (such as credit card numbers and the like), then concludes by
changing the state of the order from "open" to "active".  Standard state-transition machinery
can then engage to take care of all remaining processing.  (This is likewise glossed over at the moment.)
</ul>

Each URL has a function to back it up, defined on separate pages.
