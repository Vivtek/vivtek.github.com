Here are a few things that the library functions will use (and adaptor code as well) but that don't really need
to be exposed to the cold, hard world.  First are the IDs for the types of adaptor.  This will almost certainly end
up being a partial list.
<p></p>
<i>(Sep 15, 2001)</i>: For the <a href="../popup/index.html">popup UI framework</a> I came up with a few new adaptors
(numbers 11 through 15 there).  These will be of use for non-UI installations as well, particularly once I sit down to
write the server daemon framework (and I've already got a paying customer lined up for that one!)

<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>
</pre></td></tr></table>

And the other is the definition of the WFTK_ADAPTOR structure used to pass APIs back and forth.  Sort of a poor
man's ActiveX, I guess.  See the <a href="wftk_adaptors.html">adaptor handling code</a> for a little more detail,
but the upshot is that the interface
to an adaptor is a kind of explicit vtable, and calls to adaptors all work through a single function.
<p></p>
For the case where we want a list of all the configured adaptors in a given class (like debug adaptors or task index
adaptors, both of which are notification-like affairs where everybody involved wants to get notified) we have an
adaptor list structure which can hold several adaptors.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>#ifndef WFTK_EXPORT
#define WFTK_EXPORT
#endif

</pre></td></tr></table>

Then we have the interface to the config module.  Lest this be missed (somehow), each installation of the wftk has a single
config module, which is static-linked in.  There will be variants, however, at least between Windows and Unix, as Unix
tends to favor precompiled directory locations, while Windows favors the Registry, because most users don't have a working
compiler.
<p></p>
There are two functions of interest; <code>config_get_value</code> gets a named value, and <code>config_debug_message</code>
passes a message to any installed debugging adaptors.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre></pre></td></tr></table>

To make debugging simpler, and to make it go away when not in use so as to save space, we'll define a couple of debugging
macros to wrap around <code>config_debug_message</code>:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>#ifdef DEBUG
#define DBG(x,y) config_debug_message (x, y);
#define DBG1(x,y,z) config_debug_message (x, y, z);
#define DBG2(x,y,z,now) config_debug_message (x, y, z, now);
#else
#define DBG(x,y) ;
#define DBG1(x,y,z) ;
#define DBG2(x,y,z,now) ;
#endif
</pre></td></tr></table>

Prototypes for the adaptor functions, which are defined <a href="wftk_adaptors.html">here</a>.  The single-bore adaptor
calls may return XML values; the shotgun approach ones (list calls) are used for outgoing simultaneous notification to
multiple adaptors of a single class, so they don't return any value.  The integer is there ... I'm not sure why it's there,
but someday I might, in a fit of guilt, decide that an error return would be a good idea.
<p></p>
<i>(July 22, 2001)</i> The DSREP_database adaptor, which I'm compiling into a DLL, needs to load
the database adaptor specified -- so it needs the adaptor functions to be exported.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre></pre></td></tr></table>

We've got a couple of prototypes for functions that are supposed to be called only internally.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XML * _procdef_load (XML * session, XML * datasheet);
char * _wftk_value_special (XML * session, XML * datasheet, const char * name);
</pre></td></tr></table>
