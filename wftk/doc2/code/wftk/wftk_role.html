Roles are pretty loose at this point.  Basically, we want to be able to list the roles in a process, determine who's
assigned to them at the moment (by default, once someone gets a task, that person gets further tasks assigned to that role
in that process.  The only way to get out of this is to de-assign the role or send a request to somebody else.)

<i>June 2, 2003</i>: It's been a while since I was here...  So long, apparently, that the XMLAPI had matured a lot.  So I
simplified the code here by using xml_locf and stuff.  Also changed role addressing to work with "id" instead of "name" so
that that would work.  TODO: we really kind of need to think about global role assignments.
