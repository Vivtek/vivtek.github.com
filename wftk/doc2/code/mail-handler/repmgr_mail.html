<h2>Incoming mail handler for repmgr</h2>
<hr>
One of the basic building blocks of most halfway interesting data-management systems is the ability to process email.  This can
take one of two forms: either the mail should simply be regarded as data, or it may actually contain instructions.  Either way,
we require a system component which can accept mail and do something with it.  That component is the <i>mail handler</i>.  It
is important to note that the mail handler is concerned with <i>incoming</i> mail.  Outgoing mail is created by a notification
adaptor.  Quite a different beast, as a mail handler is actually a client application and thus calls the wftk instead of being
called by it.
<p></p>
Ideally, there would be two different mail handlers, one for the repository manager and one for the bare wftk core.  However,
as I'm not actually <i>using</i> wftk-bare, I'm not terribly motivated to work with it.  So I'm concentrating on the repmgr first.
<p></p>
Actually handling mail is really not a terribly onerous task.  Most of the work consists of parsing the MIME format and
deciding which bits of it are useful text.  That's done in the <a href="mail_reader.html">mail reader</a>, which is called
by the handler application.
<p></p>
Once the mail is parsed, we simply add it as an object.  The add operation may well involve indexing into a database, or the
execution of arbitrary workflow code.  From this vantage, we neither know nor care.  Note that this may mean a scaling
vulnerability -- if considerable work is done to add the object, the mail handler may not be the place to do that work, as a mail
handler process is created for each and every mail received.  If you experience scaling difficulties with incoming mail, one tuning
suggestion might be to drop mail into a standard mbox and use the LIST_mbox adaptor to read it in a periodic batch.

Here are the command-line flags the mail handler will look at:
<table>
<tr><td><code>-r</code></td><td>Specifies location of repository definition.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-l</code></td><td>Names the list into which this mail should be added.</td></tr>
