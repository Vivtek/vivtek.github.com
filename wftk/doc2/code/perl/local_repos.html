<i>December 26, 2003</i>:
Well, here we are, starting out on a new chapter of wftk history.  I seem to have reached the breaking
point with really wanting to write Perl scripts (my hack-until-it-works weapon of choice) against wftk
repositories.  And so I have built an actual CPAN module, and here we go.
<p></p>
The basic structure of this module is a lot like our other OO efforts of the past year; we have
a main module "wftk", which has a "Repository" submodule, and thence "Local" and "SOAP" subsubmodules.
Each subsub implements a variant of the repository on whatever platform works.  I anticipate other
implementations at some point, but (as always) not yet.
<p></p>
This page defines the central package of the module, which really doesn't do a whole lot -- meaning it's an
excellent way to introduce the mechanics of the package itself, before we get into heavier lifting in our
subs and subsubs.  First off, let's bow to the standards and realize that a package definition <i>includes
documentation</i>.  That's pretty darned cool.  But from a writing standpoint, we probably want the documentation
up front, so we define what we're writing, then below that, we implement it.  Isn't it handy, therefore, that
we are doing literate programming?  (Yes, I get confused between levels, too.  But it's all good clean fun in the end.)

Next comes the setup and code of the module itself, which we'll define below:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre><i>See <a href=""></a></i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

And now we're free to write our POD documentation right up front here, defining what the
package is and how it will be used.  The final HTML formatting of this will eventually end up in
the documentation section.

<pre>=head1 NAME

wftk::Repository::Local - Inline-structured Perl wrapper to a local wftk/repmgr-based
repository.  This is used automatically as needed by wftk::Repository, so there's
no need to call it in practice.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Like all possible repository implementations, this should support the repmgr OO schema.
Unlike remote implementations, it will also need some kind of machinery to organize
adaptors.  Since we want to be able to write adaptors in Perl (or anything else!) this
might get interesting.  Watch this space for further details.

Well, that could be more informative, but you get the idea.  Now we're free to define our actual code.
