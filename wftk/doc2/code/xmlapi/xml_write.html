<hr>
Writing the contents of one of our XML structures out into a file is simple.  We've got two
different variants on this function; one writes the entire element (<code>xml_write</code>)
and the other writes just the content of the element (<code>xml_writecontent</code>).
<p></p>
<i>October 13, 2001</i>: So I've just realized where I cut a corner, and it's bit me painfully.
I'm simply writing the content of strings without thinking -- but I need to escape any ampersands
and angle brackets.  Otherwise I can't parse what I write, and that's pretty boneheaded.  And the
worst of it is, I <i>remember</i> thinking, back a couple years ago, "I need to come back and fix
this later."  What an idiot I was.  Hear me, past me?  You're an idiot!  So here's a little
helper function to escape strings.
<p></p>
<i>(October 14, 2001)</i>: And now the UTF-8 thing has bitten me.  Expat uses UTF-8 internally, meaning
that all data returned during the parse is UTF-8 encoded.  I never really realized that.  Anyway,
when escaping data which is greater than 127, we are really working with multi-byte characters.  See
the default case in the switch below to see what I mean.

<p></p>
<i>(April 13, 2002)</i>: Finally I'm to the point where this is getting tested (as the spam trap at
<a href="http://www.despammed.com">Despammed.com</a>) -- and of course it is completely broken.  My
reference this time around is <a href="http://cuisung.unige.ch/prod/utf-8.7.html">here</a>.  The
upshot of UTF-8 is that values over 0x7F are broken into pieces and spread over multiple bytes.
The first byte contains an indication of how long the whole thing is, and subsequent bytes fill in
the rest of the data.  Subsequent bytes are all of the form 10xxxxxx, thus giving six bits apiece
to the end result.  The first byte supplies varying amounts depending on the total length.  The
whole thing all in all is capable of representing the entire four-byte UCS character space, which
of course all the language on Earth together don't fill up.  It's a neat system.  Read up on it.

<p></p>
<i>(March 2, 2004)</i>: Something I've been meaning to do for a while: I'm rewriting all this
to work with general writer function, much like xml_parse_general uses a general reader function.
This allows me to write directly to stream-like things (like Oracle LOBs) without first building
a string in memory, and it'll also help us get independent of runtime dependencies under Windows,
which have been an irritant for a long time.

And here's the actual XML writing function.  Stupid, stupid.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XMLAPI void xml_write (FILE * file, XML * xml) { xml_write_general ((void *) file, (XMLAPI_DATAWRITE) fwrite, xml); }
XMLAPI void xml_write_general (void * data, XMLAPI_DATAWRITE write, XML * xml) {
   ATTR * attr;
   ELEMENTLIST * list;

   if (!xml) return;
</pre></td></tr></table>

First, if the element we're working on is plain text, we just write it out.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   if (xml->name == NULL) {
      if (xml->attrs) if (xml->attrs->value) _xml_fwrite_escaped (data, write, xml->attrs->value);
      return;
   }
</pre></td></tr></table>

It's a regular element, so we open the element and write the name.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   _xml_fwrite (data, write, "&lt;");
   _xml_fwrite (data, write, xml->name);
   attr = xml->attrs;
   while (attr != NULL) {
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, " ");
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, attr->name);
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, "=\"");
      _xml_fwrite_escaped (data, write, attr->value);
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, "\"");
      attr = attr->next;
   }
</pre></td></tr></table>

If the element has no children (this includes text), then we close the tag as an empty tag,
and we're finished.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   if (xml->children == NULL) {
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, "/>");
      return;
   } else _xml_fwrite (data, write, ">");
</pre></td></tr></table>

Otherwise we track down the list of children and write each of them, recursively.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   xml_writecontent_general (data, write, xml);
</pre></td></tr></table>

And finally, if there were children, then we need to close the tag with the full close.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   _xml_fwrite (data, write, "&lt;/");
   _xml_fwrite (data, write, xml->name);
   _xml_fwrite (data, write, ">");
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

The weakness of this function currently is that in the absence of plain text there will never
be a line break.  Not good -- but I don't see a good algorithm for doing it better while
ruling out the possibility of inserting line breaks where they'll be errors. <i>(May 27, 2001):</i>
Lately I've just been inserting linefeeds when I want pretty printing.  The problem with <i>that</i>,
of course, is the Unix/Windows CRLF issue.  I'm still not sure how best to handle it.
<p></p>
Oh, well.  Let's go ahead and define our xml_writecontent.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XMLAPI void xml_writecontent (FILE * file, XML * xml) { xml_writecontent_general ((void *) file, (XMLAPI_DATAWRITE) fwrite, xml); }
XMLAPI void xml_writecontent_general (void * data, XMLAPI_DATAWRITE write, XML * xml)
{
   ELEMENTLIST * list;

   if (!xml) return;
   list = xml->children;
   while (list) {
      xml_write_general (data, write, list->element);
      list = list->next;
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

<i>(May 27, 2001)</i>: we need similar functions to write valid (or pretty good, anyway) HTML given an 
XML-ish input.  I should probably go look up the XHTML standard, but I'm too busy.  If you use this
library and want to tell me off, do so.
<p></p>
<i>(October 20, 2001)</i>: in order for template expression to work, I've decided that writing HTML is
<i>not</i> escaped.  The literal text in the XML is written to output; that means it parses back in
differently from the original data, but that's what we want in this case.  (It's just for XML that
we expect the written file to parse to the same data structure we started with...)
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XMLAPI void xml_writehtml (FILE * file, XML * xml) { xml_writehtml_general ((void *) file, (XMLAPI_DATAWRITE) fwrite, xml); }
XMLAPI void xml_writehtml_general (void * data, XMLAPI_DATAWRITE write, XML * xml)
{
   ATTR * attr;
   ELEMENTLIST * list;

   if (!xml) return;
   if (xml->name == NULL) {
      if (xml->attrs) if (xml->attrs->value) _xml_fwrite (data, write, xml->attrs->value);
      return;
   }

   if (xml_is (xml, "nbsp")) {
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, "&amp;nbsp;");
      return;
   }

   _xml_fwrite (data, write, "&lt;");
   _xml_fwrite (data, write, xml->name);
   attr = xml->attrs;
   while (attr != NULL) {
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, " ");
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, attr->name);
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, "=\"");
      _xml_fwrite_escaped (data, write, attr->value);
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, "\"");
      attr = attr->next;
   }
</pre></td></tr></table>

If the element has no children (this includes text), then in XML we would close the tag as an empty tag, but in
HTML we don't.  That's difference number one.  Also, a couple of tags should get full closes even if they're empty,
so we'll handle that here.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   _xml_fwrite (data, write, ">");
   if (xml->children == NULL) {
      if (!strcmp (xml->name, "p") ||
          !strcmp (xml->name, "a") ||
          !strcmp (xml->name, "textarea")) {
         _xml_fwrite (data, write, "&lt;/");
         _xml_fwrite (data, write, xml->name);
         _xml_fwrite (data, write, ">");
      }
      return;
   }

   xml_writecontenthtml_general (data, write, xml);
</pre></td></tr></table>

And finally, if there were children, then only some HTML elements get a close tag, and others don't.  That's the
other difference, from the point of view of writing.  (From the point of view of parsing, HTML is much, much
uglier, which is the motivation for XML in the first place, really.)
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   if (!strcmp (xml->name, "li") ||
       !strcmp (xml->name, "opt")) {
   } else {
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, "&lt;/");
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, xml->name);
      _xml_fwrite (data, write, ">");
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

And of course we need the same thing for content-only:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XMLAPI void xml_writecontenthtml (FILE * file, XML * xml) { xml_writecontenthtml_general ((void *) file, (XMLAPI_DATAWRITE) fwrite, xml); }
XMLAPI void xml_writecontenthtml_general (void * data, XMLAPI_DATAWRITE write, XML * xml)
{
   ELEMENTLIST * list;

   if (!xml) return;
   list = xml->children;
   while (list) {
      xml_writehtml_general (data, write, list->element);
      list = list->next;
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

<i>(July 22, 2001)</i> Due to Microsoft's lovely distinction between the file handles in the
LIBC and MSVCRT runtimes (static and dynamic linking respectively), a simple xml_write can
often fail if you've opened the file with a different runtime library than XMLAPI is using.
Thus I came up with xml_output for handy debugging; I'm sure there are other uses as well, but
that's what prompted me actually to write the function.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XMLAPI int xml_output (char * f, XML * xml, int mode)
{
   FILE * file;

   file = fopen (f, "w");
   if (!file) return 0;

   switch (mode) {
      case 1: xml_writecontent (file, xml); break;
      case 2: xml_writehtml (file, xml); break;
      case 3: xml_writecontenthtml (file, xml); break;
      default: xml_write (file, xml); break;
   }

   fclose (file);
   return 1;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

<i>(December 17, 2001)</i> I never use the above function, really; it's too cumbersome to remember
the modes.  But the basic idea of being able to read and write to/from files without having to
build the filename -- that's kinda neat.  So I came up with xml_load and xml_save.  These are
two functions which would be <i>completely</i> superfluous in the Python wrapper, so you won't
find them there.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XMLAPI XML * xml_load (const char * spec, ...)
{
   va_list args;
   char * filename;
   FILE * file;
   XML * ret;

   va_start (args, spec);
   filename = xml_string_formatv (spec, args);
   va_end (args);

   file = fopen (filename, "r");
   free (filename);
   if (!file) {
      return NULL;
   }

   ret = xml_read_error (file);
   fclose (file);

   return ret;
}
XMLAPI int xml_save (XML * xml, const char * spec, ...)
{
   va_list args;
   char * filename;
   FILE * file;
   XML * ret;

   va_start (args, spec);
   filename = xml_string_formatv (spec, args);
   va_end (args);

   file = fopen (filename, "w");
   free (filename);
   if (!file) {
      return 1;
   }

   xml_write (file, xml);
   fprintf (file, "\n");

   fclose (file);
   return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
