<h2>xmlobj: XML object storage</h2>
<hr>
This set of routines is logically somewhat separate from the XMLAPI itself, as it implements an
object storage system (with fields, links, and what-not) on top of the XMLAPI, using it as a handy
internal storage format which has its own serialization mechanism built in.
<p></p>
The xmlobj library started out as part of the <a href="../repmgr/index.html">repository manager</a>
section of the wftk, but upon closer examination it became fairly clear that wftk-only applications
could benefit from this code without needing full-fledge repository management.  So I pulled it
over here.
<p></p>
The upshot of the object storage format is simple: the XML object is taken to contain some mixture of
arbitrary XML along with "field" elements.  The field elements are primarily what xmlobj works with:
it finds them using an "id" attribute, and manipulates their values.  The basic field structure stores
its value as the field element's content.  Further refinement is possible: a field may contain a list
of values, for instance, or a set of value versions.  The field may have a type or format.  Links are
also supported (more later on that).  A class definition object may also be passed in, and will
determine visibility of fields, default values for missing fields, and so on.
<p></p>
The key: any XML not understood by the xmlobj library is <i>completely ignored</i>, which makes it
simple to store arbitrary information in such a record.  This is the new model for the wftk datasheet,
which rationalizes a lot of the flailing around in earlier wftk versions.
<p></p>
<i>May 4, 2002:</i> Which is all fine and well, but most people don't use XML this way.  So instead, I've
decided to augment the search capability of the field retrieval mechanism; if a field is named, say, "address",
then the retriever will work equally well with &lt;field id="address"&gt;1029 S. 15th Street&lt;/field&gt; <i>or</i>
with &lt;address&gt;1029 S. 15 Street&lt;/address&gt; -- much more reasonable.  To set a value which is an
element, I extend the API with an xmlobj_set_elem function.  xmlobj_set will still create a field element, but
it will happily set the value of an element field if it finds one.
<p></p>
The really nice thing about this extension is that we can think about convenient dotted naming for more complex
values: the name "address.line[0]" can refer to an xml_loc-like array arrangement, and so on.  I think this is going
to be extremely convenient to use.
<p></p>
<i>June 18, 2003:</i> Thanks to startext GmbH, I'm putting in that convenient dotted naming for more complex values.
Like the xml_loc syntax, (parens) refer to numbered offsets in lists and [square brackets] to keyed list entries
using an "id" attribute.  Dots go one level down with subrecords.  Eventually, the repository manager will also
work with this stuff to index subrecords within lists and so forth.  This is a neat extension.
<p></p>
<i>February 28, 2004</i>: Well.  The dotted syntax I finished in June of last year when I first attacked it, but
for some reason I got blocked on the indexed forms of addressing.  So as it turns out, I'm doing a lot of work
under Tcl with the wftk this month, and since getting and releasing XML handles is a bit of a hassle under Tcl
the way I have things set up, I realized it was going to be a lot easier to handle these complex indexed data
structures if I finished the indexed addressing.  So I did.  Still a couple of to-do points in there, but by
and large it works, and it was a lot easier than I'd anticipated.  I guess my subconscious has been working on
it for half a year now.
