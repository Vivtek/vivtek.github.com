<h2>Wiki Compiler</h2>
<hr>
The Wiki compiler takes a list of sort-of plain text files and formats and collates them to make HTML
suitable for embedding.
It cross-references all images and links used in the Wiki, creating a to-do list if components are
missing.
This could probably remain unstated, but it is a work in progress.
