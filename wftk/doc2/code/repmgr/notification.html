<i>(March 13, 2004)</i>: Surely I'll be done with this API someday, but apparently not yet.  Notification is the latest thing I
realized needed to be done better in the repository manager than it was in core workflow and the prototype.  Notification basically
combines two things: response to events, and outgoing email or similar things.  There are two "simplest notifications" one can
imagine.  One is simply the assertion that some event has occurred; in this case, the system should Do The Right Thing to tell
interested parties that this is the case (this may depend on an object associated with the event, etc.)  The other minimal
case is simply the ability to, as I put it, just send a fricking email.  It's a simple enough thing.  It should be simple to do.
But it's amazing sometimes how very non-simple these things are.
<p></p>
At any rate, there are a number of complicating factors between these two minimal cases.  Do we log events?  Do we log notifications
sent?  For a given user, do we send email or just make an entry to be seen when the user logs in?  Do we send messages every time
something happens, or just a daily digest?  I think you could put an arbitrary amount of work into perfecting a really good
notification facility.

<p></p>
The first of our two notification API functions is the named-notification model.  Given a notification ID, it looks the notification
up and then calls the direct version below to actually do the dirty work.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT void repos_notify (XML * repository, const char * list, const char * key, XML * obj, const char * notification_id,
                               const char * subject, const char * recipient)
{
   XML * notification;

   notification = repos_get (repository, "_notifications", notification_id);
   if (notification) {
      repos_notify_direct (repository, list, key, obj, notification, subject, recipient);
      xml_free (notification);
   } else {
      repos_log (repository, 2, 2, NULL, "notification", "repos_notify: can't find named notification %s", notification_id);
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

Once we have our notification (or of course if we already have a notification structure, say, from the workflow we're running),
then we can execute it.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
