<hr>
<i>(January 26, 2003)</i>:  <i>Asynchronous processing</i> is a catchall term for the following kinds of things a complete system
should be able to do (note that support for this kind of thing requires a complete system, not just the repmgr library.)
<ul>
<li>Task timeouts and deadlines
<li>Queue handling
<li>Periodic reports
<li>Deferred processing for publishing
</ul>

In general, the repos_process call can be thought of as supporting any daemon process which should run in a complete system and do
work that should be done in the background while a user isn't waiting on the result.  The particular motivator for this feature is
task timeouts, which allow limits to be placed on the time that objects may spend in particular states and will trigger automatic
state transitions if those time limits are exceeded.  There is plenty of special logic for that one application built into this
section.
