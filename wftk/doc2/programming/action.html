<h3>Actions</h3>
The <i>action</i> functionality of wftk is really very powerful.  To use it, you first build an action structure, which (like everything
else in the wftk) is an XML element.  The action structure encodes what is effectively a function call; an action adaptor handles the actual
processing of the action.  But before it's passed to the action adaptor, the action is compared to a permissions database along with the
current userid.  The permissions database specifies one of three permission levels for that action for that user: full permission (the action
is processed immediately), no permission (the action is denied), or subject to approval.  If the action is subject to approval, then the
permissions database specifies a process to be started in order to get that approval.
<p>
The key is this: the action is attached to the approval process.  So when the process completes successfully, the action will be processed
automatically.  If the process doesn't complete (i.e. it's rejected at some point) then the action is naturally not processed.
<p>
So the action functionality presents a very powerful and flexible way to control actions taken.  You can easily specify and parameterize
an action as an arbitrary request, then build and change permission structures as necessary as your needs change.
<h3>Action structure</h3>
The action structure is simple, so I'll just give you an example:
<pre>
&lt;action action="procadhoc" handler="wftk" process="42">
  &lt;task ...>
&lt;/action>
</pre>
The <code>procadhoc</code> action of the wftk action handler attaches ad-hoc workflow to the identified process.  The content of an action
structure is arbitrary; the action handler should do with it whatever is appropriate.  Many actions will have no content:
<pre>
&lt;action action="procstart" handler="wftk" process="chair"/>
</pre>
As of this writing (May 17, 2001) I've got two action handlers; the wftk handler encapsulates some of the wftk API itself, and the system
handler encapsulates system calls.  The system handler is very raw.  Anyway, neither of them is well-documented, so that's yet another thing
I need to come back to later.  Please <a href="mailto:wftk@vivtek.com">bother me about it</a> if you would.  Thanks.
<p>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<pre>
int wftk_action (void * session, XML * action);
</pre>

<h3>Details</h3>
<a name="wftk_action"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_action</font> returns <code>int</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * action</code>
</blockquote>
Not a lot needs to be said about the actual function beyond what you see above.  You build an action structure using the <a href="xmlapi/index.html">XMLAPI</a>, you allocate a <a href="session.html">session</a>, and you call the function.  The return code
of the function is nonzero on success, and the action structure itself will be decorated with diagnostic information in the <i>status</i>
and <i>status.reason</i> attributes.  The <i>status</i> attribute will be "ok" if the action was taken with no approval necessary, "no"
if no action was permitted, or "deferred" if an approval process was started.  The <i>status.reason</i> is supplied in the permissions
database and is arbitrary but a nice thing for user interfaces to display.
<p>
If the action is deferred, then the action structure is further decorated with attributes <code>dsrep</code> and <code>process</code>, which
encode the actual process started.
