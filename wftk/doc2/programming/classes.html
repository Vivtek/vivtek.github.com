<h2>Programmer's Guide to the wftk -- OO class schema</h2>
[ <a href="../index.html">wftk documentation home</a> ]
<hr>

The OO schema for the wftk is still young -- in fact, as of this writing, it hasn't been implemented
in any language yet.  The idea, however, is that all OO languages should see the same objects, 
attributes, and methods, allowing simple portability of wftk applications and techniques to whatever
language you're using.
<p>
The initial idea of this document (as of 19 Sep 2002) is to lay out and justify the existence of the
basic objects in the schema; as I have time and motivation, the methods and attributes of all these
object will be filled in.  If anyone has suggestions as to the best way to graphically present these
beasts, chip in.

<ul>
<li>object <b>xmlapi</b><br>The XMLAPI object underlies all data structures used by the wftk.
<li>object <b>xmlobj</b> is-a <i>xmlapi</i><br>The xmlobj library defines a record structure, with versioned values, a list definition, and so forth.
<li>object <b>listdefn</b> is-a <i>xmlapi</i><br>The listdefn object defines default values, optional and required fields, attachments, workflow triggers, visibility and permissions, storage (sometimes), and a raft of other things about data objects.
<li>object <b>repository</b> is-a <i>xmlapi</i><br>The repository object describes the range of lists available to the current application (in listdefn objects), publishers, layouts, etc.
<li>object <b>layout</b> is-a <i>xmlapi</i><br>Not sure if I even really need this ...
<li>object <b>publisher</b> is-a <i>xmlapi</i><br> ... or this...
<li>object <b>datasheet</b> is-a <i>xmlobj</i><br>The datasheet represents a workflow process.  Note
that a repository manager list object generally corresponds to a datasheet.
<li>object <b>task</b> is-a <i>xmlobj</i><br>A workflow task.
<li>object <b>request</b> is-a <i>xmlobj</i><br>A workflow request.
<li>object <b>user</b> is-a <i>xmlobj</i><br>A user, whether the current one or some other.
<li>object <b>notification</b> is-a <i>xmlapi</i><br>Again -- not sure where I'm going with this one.
<li>object <b>query</b> is-a <i>xmlapi</i><br>To retrieve information from the wftk, you create a
query object, fill it out with some parameters, then you toss it to the wftk to be filled out.
</ul>
