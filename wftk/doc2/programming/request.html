<h3>Requests</h3>
From the point of view of the user, a request looks a lot like a task.  But when you look more closely,
the wftk request is a powerful functionality.  A request can indeed be a simple task request -- i.e.
"can you do this task?"  The task may either be already in existence, or not; if it is, then acceptance
of the request will transfer assignment of the task.  If not, a new ad-hoc task will be created.
<p>
However, a request can be more refined than that.  You can make a request of a user that they take over
an entire role in a process -- if they accept, then all subsequent tasks assigned to that role will be
assigned to the user automatically.  You can make a request that contains completely arbitrary workflow;
if accepted, the workflow is added to the process as ad-hoc workflow, some of which may be tasks
assigned to the requestee, but others of which may be assigned to any arbitrary user or group.  This
will probably be most useful when various notifications should be sent out upon acceptance, but since
it's so open-ended, it'll find plenty of uses, I'm sure.
<p>
But back to that sending a task-assumption request for a moment: this effectively implements a
token-based workflow delegation system.  In fact, if I receive a request, I can make a new request of
someone else that <i>they</i> fulfill my request, and they will be treated as the acceptor of the
original request in that case.  Entire hierarchies of delegation can thus be built on this mechanism.
I do want to talk to the first person actually to <i>implement</i> this in a real situation, though.
<p>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<pre>
int    wftk_request_list     (void * session, XML * list);
int    wftk_request_new      (void * session, XML * request);
XML  * wftk_request_retrieve (void * session, XML * request);
int    wftk_request_update   (void * session, XML * request);
int    wftk_request_rescind  (void * session, XML * request);
int    wftk_request_accept   (void * session, XML * request);
int    wftk_request_decline  (void * session, XML * request);
</pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<a name="wftk_request_list"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_request_list</font> returns <code>int</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * list</code>
</blockquote>
Returns a (possibly filtered) list of requests.  Like other listing functions in the wftk,
this function takes a list XML structure decorated with filtering attributes.  Upon return,
the list contains elements corresponding to the matching requests.  Lists may be reused, but
you have to clean up old results yourself (if you want them cleaned up).
<br><br>
If a process ID is given to the list, the datasheet will be loaded and scanned for requests;
otherwise, the default task index (database) is asked.  This means effectively that when using
wftk in a non-database-enabled environment, you must supply a process ID to list requests.
(This applies equally to tasks and so forth.)

<br><br>

<a name="wftk_request_new"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_request_new</font> returns <code>int</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * request</code>
</blockquote>

<br><br>

<a name="wftk_request_new"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_request_new</font> returns <code>int</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * request</code>
</blockquote>
Creates a new request.  The request element you supply should have a process ID if the
process is to be attached to a process, and should have a user ID if the request is to be
made of a specific user.  I know this is too thin for good documentation, but I'll finish
it up later.

<br><br>

<a name="wftk_request_retrieve"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_request_retrieve</font> returns <code>XML *</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * request</code>
</blockquote>
Retrieves the specified request (by filling out the given XML).  A pointer to the given
XML is returned; NULL means no such request was found.

<br><br>

<a name="wftk_request_update"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_request_update</font> returns <code>int</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * request</code>
</blockquote>
Updates the given request (this means writing it to the associated datasheet, if any, and
writing it to the database, if any.)

<br><br>

<a name="wftk_request_rescind"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_request_rescind</font> returns <code>int</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * request</code>
</blockquote>
Rescinds the specified request (deletes it from datasheet and database).

<br><br>

<a name="wftk_request_accept"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_request_accept</font> returns <code>int</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * request</code>
</blockquote>

Accepts the given request.  This can entail quite a lot of work, as tasks may be created, adhoc
workflow added to the process, status changed on things; the wftk takes care of all that on 
acceptance.

<br><br>

<a name="wftk_request_decline"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_request_decline</font> returns <code>int</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * request</code>
</blockquote>

Declines the given request.  Less happens when a request is declined, but there is still work
to be done (notifications if nothing else.)
