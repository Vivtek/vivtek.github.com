<h2>Programmer's Guide to the XMLAPI</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The XMLAPI is a DOM-like library which maintains heap structures based on XML documents.  These
heap structures have the advantage that they can be read from or written to XML documents, of course,
but I'm finding that they're pretty nice to have around anyway.  An XML element itself acts a lot like
an associative array (a hash, for you Perl junkies), and that alone is a nice reason to use the XMLAPI
in C.  For me, anyway.
<p>
This documentation is intended to stand alone, even though it's part of the wftk documentation set.
As I've ported (parts of) the XMLAPI into Perl so that I can work with the same API, and as that has
nothing whatsoever to do with wftk, I think it makes sense to arrange things this way.  So if you're
reading this and haven't heard of <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/wftk.html">the wftk</a>, don't panic,
it's just the project during which I started working on an XML API, which later became the XMLAPI.  See?
But if you're figuring out how to work with the wftk, don't panic when I don't talk about it much.
<p>
Anyway, besides reading and writing to files, there are a whole lot of things you can do with these
XML heap structures.  I've broken these down into categories so they're not completely overwhelming.

<a name="io"></a><h3>Reading and writing XML files</h3>
Reading of XML is done with the expat parser by James Clark.  There are three flavors --
<code>xml_read</code> reads a file handle and returns an XML structure.  If any error is encountered,
it bails, returning NULL.  If you want error feedback, use <code>xml_read_error</code> (I realized this
need after the fact, and in fact early versions of <code>xml_read</code> actually wrote the error
message to <code>stdout</code>, which wasn't very friendly behavior at all.)  The
<code>xml_read_error</code> is a perfectly normal XML reader, but instead
of returning NULL in case of error, it returns an error element of the form<pre>
   &lt;xml-error code="200" message="some error message" line="40"/&gt;
</pre>
The third parsing function, <code>xml_parse</code> simply takes a string buffer and parses that.
The buffer must be null-terminated.  It also returns an error element in case of error (not NULL).
<p>
Writing is done fairly simply by walking the XML
tree structure.  Pretty printing (breaking lines) isn't supported; if you want pretty XML, you have to
insert your own line breaks when building the XML in the first place.
<p>
Use the <code>xml_writecontent</code> to write only the subelements of the XML passed in without writing
the enclosing element or its attributes.

<ul>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_read (FILE * in);</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_read_error (FILE * in);</b></code><br>
Reads XML from the stream given.  <code>xml_read</code> returns NULL in case of error;
<code>xml_read_error</code> returns an error structure (as above).

<li><code><b>XML * xml_parse (const char * in);</b></code><br>
Reads XML from a null-terminated string buffer.

<li><code><b>void xml_write (FILE * out, XML * xml);</b></code>
<li><code><b>void xml_writecontent (FILE * out, XML * xml);</b></code><br>
Writes a full XML element to the stream given, or writes all the children of the given element.
</ul>

<a name="html"></a><h3>Writing XML as HTML</h3>
Writing HTML is pretty much the same as writing XML, except that some HTML elements are treated special:
<code>li</code>, for instance, doesn't need to be closed.  That sort of thing.

<ul>
<li><code><b>void xml_writehtml (FILE * out, XML * xml);</b></code>
<li><code><b>void xml_writecontenthtml (FILE * out, XML * xml);</b></code><br>
Writes a full XML element to the stream given, or writes all the children of the given element.
</ul>

<a name="create"></a><h3>Creating new XML from scratch or by copying</h3>
To create a new XML element, you just give its name.  Afterwards you can insert content, or insert it
<i>as</i> content, and set attributes.  Plain text (character sequences) are represented as elements
with no name.  Use <code>xml_createtext</code> to create a non-element XML.  The
<code>xml_createtextf</code> function works the same, except that it takes a <code>printf</code>-like
format (at the moment it understands only %s and %d).
<p>
Use <code>xml_delete</code> to delete a subelement from a parent element; <code>xml_delete</code> calls
<code>xml_free</code> on the deleted element.  Call <code>xml_free</code> directly if the element isn't
a child element (it won't clean up the dangling child pointer in a parent.)

<ul>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_create (const char *name);</b></code><br>
Creates a new element with the given name.
<li><code><b>XML * xml_createtext (const char *content);</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_createtextf (const char *format, ...);</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_createtextlen (const char *content, int len);</b></code><br>
Create plaintext elements.  The first duplicates the null-terminated content, the second treats its
first argument as a format, and the third takes a length parameter so you don't have to null-terminate.
</ul>

<a name="string"></a><h3>Generating string representations of XML</h3>
The string generators build string buffers using <code>malloc</code>.  Thus you have to free the result
when you're done with it.  The <code>*content</code> functions, like <code>xml_writecontent</code>,
don't write the enclosing element or its attributes, just its subelements.  The <code>*html</code>
functions convert the given XML into an HTML-like form while writing.  (The given XML is of course
unchanged.)

<ul>
<li><code><b>char * xml_string (XML * xml);</b></code><br>
Creates a malloc'd string corresponding to the text representation of the given XML.
<li><code><b>char * xml_stringcontent (XML * xml);</b></code><br>
Does the same but writes only the child elements of the given XML, not the topmost element.
<li><code><b>char * xml_stringhtml (XML * xml);</b></code>
<li><code><b>char * xml_stringcontenthtml (XML * xml);</b></code><br>
Do the same, but apply HTML conversion to produce more-or-less correct HTML.
</ul>

<a name="set"></a><h3>Getting and setting attributes</h3>
The <code>xml_attrval</code> function returns a pointer to the named attribute or a pointer to an
empty string if the attribute isn't found, and yes, I know the function is named inconveniently.  The
pointer returned is a const pointer directly into the XML structure, so don't write to it.  Use
<code>xml_attrvalnum</code> if you just need an integer representation of the attribute's value.
<p>
The <code>xml_set*</code> functions set attributes, of course.  If the attribute is already present,
it will be replaced; otherwise, a new attribute will be created.  The <code>xml_setf</code> function
takes a format similar to <code>printf</code>'s format; it recognizes only %s and %d at the moment.
The <code>xml_set</code> makes a copy of the string value given it (and the attribute name, of course);
if you don't want the copy to be made, then use <code>xml_set_nodup</code>.  <i>Caution:</i>
<code>xml_set_nodup</code> may <i>only</i> be called with malloc'd strings!  Otherwise, when you attempt
to free the XML element, Bad Things will happen.

<ul>
<li><code><b>const char * xml_attrval (XML * xml, const char * name);</b></code>
<li><code><b>int xml_attrvalnum (XML * xml, const char * name);</b></code><br>
Retrieve attribute values from the given XML element.
<li><code><b>void xml_set (XML * xml, const char * name, const char * value);</b></code>
<li><code><b>void xml_setf (XML * xml, const char * name, const char * format, ...);</b></code>
<li><code><b>void xml_setnum (XML * xml, const char * name, int value);</b></code>
<li><code><b>void xml_set_nodup (XML * xml, const char * name, const char * value);</b></code><br>
Set attribute values in the given XML element; see above text for the differences between the four
functions.
</ul>

<a name="insert"></a><h3>Inserting and replacing subelements</h3>
Use <code>xml_prepend</code> to insert a child element before any other subelement; use
<code>xml_append</code> to insert the child after all others.  The <code>xml_replace</code> function
will replace the given element in its own parent, while <code>xml_replacecontent</code> first deletes
the given element's children, then appends the new child (thus effectively replacing the element's
children.)
<p>
The <code>xml_copyinto</code> function is a little weird.  I've only had one use for it, really.  What
is does is to take all the attributes and subelements of the source XML and write/append them,
respectively, into the target XML.  If there are duplicate attributes, the source values overwrite.
Any existing information is saved otherwise.

<ul>
<li><code><b>void xml_prepend (XML * parent, XML * child);</b></code><br>
Inserts <code>child</code> as first subelement of <code>parent</code>.
<li><code><b>void xml_append (XML * parent, XML * child);</b></code><br>
Inserts <code>child</code> as last subelement of <code>parent</code>.
<li><code><b>void xml_replace (XML * target, XML * source);</b></code><br>
Deletes <code>target</code> and inserts <code>source</code> in its place (assumes that
<code>target</code> is already the subelement of a parent element.)
<li><code><b>void xml_replacecontent (XML * parent, XML * child);</b></code><br>
Deletes all children of <code>parent</code> and inserts <code>child</code> as new content.
<li><code><b>void xml_copyinto (XML * target, XML * source);</b></code><br>
Copies all children of <code>source</code> into <code>target</code>, preserving all existing children.
Does the same with attributes, except like-named values are overwritten.
</ul>

<a name="loc"></a><h3>Element location codes</h3>
The location functions work with locator strings, which is something sort of weird I came up with.
A locator string uniquely identifies (at most) one element in an XML tree, either by place position
in its parent or by the value of its "id" attribute (or "name" attribute if it has no "id" attribute.)
This means that you don't have to manage identifiers throughout an XML document to get bits of it
out.  You can also do some primitive searching through an XML tree; the only limitation on this search
is that you have to know which level the element is at.
<p>
The following examples all work with this XML structure:<pre>
&lt;record&gt;
   &lt;field name="field1" value="4"/&gt;
   &lt;comment&gt;This is a comment, maybe a memo or something.&lt;/comment&gt;
   &lt;field name="field2" value="3"/&gt;
&lt;/record&gt;
</pre>
Then the locator <code>record.field(1)</code> will find the second field element: <code>&lt;field name="field2" value="3"/&gt;</code>.  Note that we work from a base of 0, and note that the intervening
"comment" field has no effect.  Neither would any intervening plain text.
<p>
The locator <code>record.comment</code> will find the comment field.  (Note that omission of an element
number means to return the first you find.)  You can search by ID or name, too: the locator
<code>record.field[field2]</code> will return the second field as well.
<p>
If no matching field is found, the <code>xml_loc</code> function returns a NULL pointer.
<p>
The <code>xml_locf</code> function works the same as <code>xml_loc</code> except that it can build your
locator for you using a formatting scheme much like the <code>printf</code> function.  It only
understands %s and %d at the moment, but that's probably all you'll need in locators anyway.
<p>
Both <code>loc</code> functions can ignore the element name of the topmost element if you simply
omit it; thus the locator <code>.field</code> will find the first data field in the example XML.
<p>
The <code>xml_getloc</code> and <code>xml_getlocbuf</code> functions find a locator for the given XML;
since each XML element knows its parent, the <code>getloc</code> functions can simply trace up the tree
and find a full locator.  The <code>xml_getloc</code> function requires that you supply a buffer; in
this case, the locator may fill the buffer.  Check its length carefully upon return.  The
<code>xml_getlocbuf</code> function allocates the buffer for you, but you must either free the buffer
when you're finished with it, or use <code>xml_set_nodup</code> to pass it back into an attribute for
later cleanup with an element.  The pattern
<code>xml_set_nodup (xml, "myloc", xml_getlocbuf(xml))</code> will probably be useful here and there.

<ul>
<li><code><b>void xml_getloc (XML * xml, char * loc, int len);</b></code><br>
Writes the locator of the given XML in its parent tree into the indicated buffer.
<li><code><b>char * xml_getlocbuf (XML * xml);</b></code><br>
Writes the locator into a buffer it allocates for you.  You have to free it.
<li><code><b>XML * xml_loc (XML * xml, const char * loc);</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_locf (XML * xml, const char * format, ...);</b></code><br>
Locate an XML snippet.  Return NULL if nothing matches.
</ul>

<a name="iter"></a><h3>Iterating through subelements</h3>
There are two sets of child element iteration functions; the ones ending in <code>elem</code> skip over
any plain text children and return only XML elements.  This is useful because plaintext elements have
a NULL name, so if you get one by mistake and try to compare its name with something, you will regret
it.  This happened to me so often I modified the API.  Ha.  Anyway, you can start an iteration at the
beginning of the child list or at the end, and you can move forward or backward in the list.  If you
get a NULL pointer back, you know you've reached the end (or beginning) of the list.  A useful pattern
for iteration is thus:<pre>
marker = xml_firstelem (parent);
while (marker) {
   /* do something */
   marker = xml_nextelem (marker);
}
</pre>

<ul>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_first (XML * parent)</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_last (XML * parent)</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_next (XML * child)</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_prev (XML * child)</b></code><br>
Move through the children of an element.  Note that <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> take the
current iterated child and get its neighbor, while <code>first</code> and <code>last</code> take the
parent element.
<li><code><b>XML * xml_firstelem (XML * parent)</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_lastelem (XML * parent)</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_nextelem (XML * child)</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML * xml_prevelem (XML * child)</b></code><br>
These four functions do the same, but skip plain text and work only with XML subelements.
</ul>

<a name="attr"></a><h3>Iterating through attributes</h3>
Attribute iteration is the newest section of the XMLAPI; I realized that scanning the attributes of an
element was the only place where the wftk had to know the internal structure of an element.  This seemed
as though it would make things harder once I started mixing and matching XMLAPI implementations for
embedding in scripting languages, so I closed up the loophole.  Now wftk knows (and cares) nothing at
all about what's inside these mysterious XML structures.
<p>
You can only scan attributes from the front of the list to the back (they're singly linked, so you don't
want to scan backwards anyway.)  Given an attribute, you can retrieve its name or its value.  The
unfortunate similarity of <code>xml_attrvalue</code> (which gets the value of an attribute structure)
and <code>xml_attrval</code> (which gets an attribute value from an element, treating it as a hash) is
regrettable and you have my abject apologies, but I didn't want to go back and change all my existing
code.  We'll all just have to live with my poor planning.

<ul>
<li><code><b>XML_ATTR * xml_attrfirst (XML * xml);</b></code>
<li><code><b>XML_ATTR * xml_attrnext (XML_ATTR * xml);</b></code>
<li><code><b>const char * xml_attrname (XML_ATTR * xml);</b></code>
<li><code><b>const char * xml_attrvalue (XML_ATTR * xml);</b></code><br>
Work with attributes of an element (see above for details).
</ul>
