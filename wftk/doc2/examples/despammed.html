<h3>Spam filtration</h3>
The <a href="http://www.despammed.com">Despammed.com spam filter</a> is a free service I've been running since 1999.
It scans headers for simple signs of mail abuse, then forwards any apparent non-spam to the user's chosen
address.  Lately I've been getting serious about using the vast amount of data about spam which passes through this
system to improve both my understanding of spam trends and the responsiveness of the system to new abuse.
In addition, the Despammed.com website itself includes two interesting areas in terms of wftk use: first, I maintain
a simple weblog of what's going on in my spam-fighting life; second, users of Despammed.com have various ways
of accessing the site, such as the Webmail feature.

<p>
In general, then, the Despammed.com system, which runs on two machines, uses or will use the wftk to do the following things:
<ul>
<li>Track and block IP addresses and IP ranges associated with spammers.
<li>Track and block domains associated with spammers.
<li>Field and track abuse reports from users who have received spam through the filters.
<li>Field and track false-positive reports from users having troubles receiving legitimate email.
<li>Track spam blocked by the filters and present it for users and for my own use in profiling.
<li>Allow users to view, file, and send email from the Web.
<li>Maintain a weblog of interesting news.
<li>Allow submission of useful spamfighting links.
</ul>

Many of these systems are works in progress as of 9 May 2003.  In particular, however, see the <a href=data_processing.html>white
paper I've started on wftk support of complex data processing systems</a>.
