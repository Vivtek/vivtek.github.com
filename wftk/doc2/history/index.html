<h3>The sordid history of the wftk</h3>

<b>December, 1999</b><br>
The wftk has been my brainchild and obsession since December of 1999, when I first ran across a proposal for an open-source workflow system on the now-defunct SourceXchange.  Since I had just lost a lucrative customer, I was looking for something to do with my time that might actually put some
food on the table, and this fit the bill -- and in fact, it has paid off over the subsequent years, even though it's really only now getting more or
less finished.  Well, <i>finished</i> is of course something it will never be.  But it's to the point where it's almost useful for actual intents
and purposes.
<p>
<b>Spring, 2000</b><br>
By spring, I had laid out what a workflow core engine would have to do, designed the procdef language, and written a pretty decent first cut of
the code, along with a wrapping system in Tcl under AOLserver to provide a user interface.  It was bona fide workflow, although pretty clunky in
practice, as it relied on a command-line processor which accepted workflow commands, and didn't talk directly to any databases.
<p>
<b>July, 2000</b><br>
Dabbled in a CGI interface for the editing of procdefs, and got very bogged down in that.  An initial CGI procdef editor was
released July 10, 2000.
<p>
<b>October, 2000</b><br>
First release of the prototype.
Galactic Marketing, the original proposer of the system, had quietly given up on me by this time, so I lost some
momentum at this point and entered a more quiescent phase for a while.  The prototype ran only on Windows, it could talk to 
ODBC databases but nothing else except for data stored in XML files in local directories, and consisted only of a command-line
interface (although a Windows AOLserver task manager system existed which could use it to a certain extent.)  It was just barely a
workflow system, but it <i>was</i> a workflow system.
<p>
<b>February 2001</b><br>
I woke from a winter slumber and ported the system to Unix -- of course, on Unix it couldn't talk to any database <i>at all</i>, but
it ran on Solaris by February (at the time I had no Linux system for testing.)
<p>
<b>Early 2001</b><br>
The fine folks at Startext GmbH were crazy enough at this point to hire me to adapt wftk to their project as a general, well,
open-source workflow toolkit.  So I did.  The crucial change was the separation of the wftk core engine into a module of its own,
callable from the command-line interface or <i>from other programs</i>.  Of course, this had been my initial goal, but I hadn't actually
done it.  Startext also underwrote the initial Oracle adaptor, and some other miscellaneous stuff.  And they paid!  On time!  And then
they disappeared for a while.  But I'd gotten the bee back in my bonnet.
<p>
<b>July, 2001</b><br>
The first real actual release of wftk, with Oracle and ODBC adaptors and some other neat stuff.
<p>
<b>August, 2001</b><br>
Long frustrated by the inability of the wftk to handle datasources in anything like a rational manner, I started the repository
manager from scratch, borrowing from earlier Perl work on a content management system with which I had had similar data-access
management frustration.  Workflow per se moved solidly to the back burner for a long time.
<p>
<b>November, 2001</b><br>
The repmgr module first became useful by November, talking to ODBC and MySQL databases with equal aplomb, and organizing all
datasources into functionally equivalent "lists" -- and just barely scratching the surface of everything a data management system
should do.  As usual.  But it worked, and as I was using it in a couple of production installations, it actually started to get
debugged, along with the XMLAPI library it was based on.  The repository manager also included a Python wrapper (for Windows, anyway)
which worked pretty darned well.  This started a real love affair with Python.
<p>
<b>January, 2002</b><br>
Reorganized the whole wftk concept based on the repository manager.
<p>
<b>June, 2002</b><br>
Released the wftk library as production, with the inclusion of state-based workflow.
<p>
<b>Rest of 2002</b><br>
Let's just not talk about 2002, shall we?  I hated 2002.  I made less money month after month, and obsessed about current affairs.
Only when
I decided that the United States was bound and determined to shoot itself in every available foot with or without my morbid attention
did I return to something like productivity and sanity.
<p>
<b>January, 2003</b><br>
I put the repository manager into use in a CGI context for the first time, with actual usable results.  This was the beginning of a
new head of steam for wftk.
<p>
<b>May, 2003</b><br>
Started integrating the repository manager with the wftk core engine.  The more I worked on this, the harder it got, and it was starting
to bog down in detail again, until, miracle of miracles, ...
<p>
<b>June, 2003</b><br>
The fine folks at Startext GmbH came back for more!  After some problems getting the original workflow-using project off the ground,
they were now ready to finish it -- in the meantime, wftk had moved on, <i>a lot</i>, and so had the expectations of their customer.
So they wanted a demo program to show people just what workflow was about, and I said, "Sure, gimme a couple of days!"  They also
needed some extensions to the wftk, like the application server adaptor and situation handling in the core engine.
<p>
<b>July, 2003</b><br>
A month later, it worked -- the repmgr and wftk core engines were integrated at last, and the whole thing had a handy-dandy little
Python GUI interface based on wxPython (my GUI platform of choice for quite some time.)
<p>
<b>Future</b><br>
