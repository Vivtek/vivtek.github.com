Configuration of a complete wftk system can roughly follow this plan:
<ol>
<li><b>Interface to existing systems</b><br>
Interaction with other systems is done by means of <i>adaptor</i>.  In some cases, there may
already be adaptors for the interoperable systems you need (for instance, there are database
adaptors for ODBC on Windows and for Oracle, there is a notification adaptor for SMTP outgoing
mail, and so on), but you may need to write some adaptors.  If you find yourself in that
situation, see <a href="interfaces/index.html">the Interface Writer's Guide</a>.
<li><b>Determine front-end needs</b><br>
The wftk at present (July 25, 2001) has no front-end software; it is a library suitable for
embedding in other programs.  (The exception to this is the command-line utility, but that 
doesn't expose all the functionality of the library.)  Work is in progress for a Zope frontend,
which will include a Python wrapper, and CGI programs are also easy to create for wftk.
<li><b>Create a configuration file</b><br>
The configuration file needn't actually be a file.  The configuration is attached to the session
by the calling program, so it can be implemented any way you need.  An example config.xml file
is included in the distribution; at the moment there is no other documentation.  (Coming soon.)
<li><b>Define users and groups</b><br>
If you write a user adaptor to an existing directory, you don't need this step.
<li><b>Define permissions, if you will be using the action interface</b><br>
<li><b>Define processes (procdefs)</b><br>
See the example chair procdef for, yes, sigh, the only documentation I've written so far.
</ol>
As you can see, there's a lot for me to document still.  Please bother me until you're satisfied.
