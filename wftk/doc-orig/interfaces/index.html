<h2>Interfacing the wftk with other systems</h2>
[ <a href="../index.html">wftk documentation home</a> ]
<hr>

As with most of the wftk documentation, this isn't complete.  However, here is what I hope to have in
this section:
<ul>
<li>Overview of the adaptor mechanism
<li>Documentation of the various adaptor classes
<li>Descriptions of already complete interfaces<ul>
    <li>ODBC database adaptor
    <li>Oracle database adaptor
    <li>SMTP notification adaptor
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Overview of the adaptor mechanism</h3>
The wftk is intended to do workflow-y kinds of things in whatever system you have.  In order to make
that work, nearly every system dependency that wftk has is split out into one or more <i>adaptors</i>.
An adaptor presents a unified API to wftk and identifies individual functions using string names.
It's not the most efficient way of doing things, perhaps, compared to the traditional C approach, but
it's simple to manage and simple to write to.  It's kind of like letting a bare minimum of scripting
languages into the C paradigm.
<p>
At any rate, I need to flesh this out with examples, but for the time being, look at some of the
implementations in the source directory.
