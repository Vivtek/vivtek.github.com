<h2>Programmer's Guide to the wftk</h2>
[ <a href="../index.html">wftk documentation home</a> ]
<hr>

<h3>Overview</h3>
The wftk functionality itself is contained in a library which you can use in your own applications.
As of this writing (May 14, 2001) the only example of this usage is the command-line application which
I wrote for testing of the wftk during the last round of development.  The next publically accessible
application will probably be a set of CGI programs to expose workflow functionality via HTTP.  (Although
Zope is a strong contender.)
<p>
In the wftk, a process is represented by a <i>datasheet</i>.  Internally, the datasheet is an XML 
document, which you manipulate using the <i>XMLAPI</i> library, a DOM-like set of functions which
build and modify heap-based data structures based on XML (and which can be written to and read from
actual XML files on disk or elsewhere.)  I say, "internally," because you could easily write an adaptor
which would talk to some other non-XML-based system to load a datasheet; that adaptor would build an
XMLAPI structure which would be equivalent to the standard XML file used in the stock adaptor.
<p>
The datasheet contains values (hence its name), it maintains a queue of tasks and bookmarks into
active workflows, it contains an enactment history of the process, and it will probably end up doing
more as time goes on.  In a very real sense, then, even though the users' activities focus on tasks
more than on processes, your programming will focus on processes.
<p>
<h3>Data structures</h3>
<i>All</i> data structures for the wftk are built as internal XML objects using the XMLAPI.
These are the various things you will encounter while working with the wftk:
<ul>
<li>Datasheets
<li>Process definitions (procdefs)
<li>Task objects
<li>Request objects
<li>User objects
<li>Notification (alert) objects
<li><a href="xml_list.html">List (query) objects</a>
</ul>
Obviously, a major shortcoming of the current documentation is the absence of definitions for
any of these.  I need to comb through the code to reconstruct them, so it'll be a few days yet.
Bear with me.  I never actually stop working on the wftk, I just get distracted sometimes.
<p>
<h3>Areas of functionality</h3>
Full usage of the wftk in your application may entail writing some adaptors (this process is
covered in the <a href="../interfaces/index.html">Interface Writer's Guide</a>),
but assuming your adaptor needs are already covered, you need to know about the
following groups of functions:
<ul>
<li><a href="session.html"><font size=+1>Establishing a workflow session and doing things with it</font></a><ul>
  <li>wftk_session_alloc
  <li>wftk_session_free

  <li>wftk_session_configure
  <li>wftk_session_setuser
  <li>wftk_session_getuser

</ul>
Granted, some of those categories are pretty peripheral, but that's the API as it stands right now.

<h3>Examples</h3>
For now, you can look at the code in the command-line utility, but at some point I want to snip some
working bits of code out as examples.  Most importantly, there are a couple of ways to use wftk that
you probably aren't thinking of -- for instance, you can use it as a permission system for arbitrary
actions using the <code>wftk_action</code> function.  (You can grant or revoke full permission or
cause the action to start an approval process; after approval, wftk will automatically complete the
action.)  WFTK -- it's not just for breakfast anymore.
