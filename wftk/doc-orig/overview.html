<h3>The sections of a wftk system</h3>
A typical wftk application is described as a <i>repository</i>, a set of data sources and a description
of their relationships.  There are two major segments of code, which deal with the world in
fundamentally different ways: the <i>repository manager</i>, or <i>repmgr</i>, sees data sources and
moves data, while the <i>wftk core</i> sees activities in the form of processes and tasks.  Both
segments rely on an assortment of <i>adaptors</i> which interact with the external world.
<p>
Application code interacts with wftk using either the repmgr API or the wftk core API;
however, since the repository manager itself knows how to invoke the wftk API in response to various
events, a workflow-oriented system may have no need at all to invoke the wftk core API directly.
However, for applications which want to do pure workflow without the baggage of repository management,
the wftk core is carefully independent of the repmgr (many of the stock adaptors require the repmgr,
but if you're not using those adaptors, you can be repository-free with no further ado.)
<p>
The repository manager also has a great deal of logic enabling it to format text and build Websites;
this code can also be used to maintain other "unstructured" text using the structured data sources
making up a repository.  There is also code (related to the Wiki Wiki Web paradigm) which allows
unstructured text to be processed into a formatted layout, enabling content producers to ignore
formatting completely in many cases while writing, but still preserving their ability to affect
formatting explicitly when they need to.
<p>
Here's a diagram showing all these relationships.

For more information on the workflow aspect of the wftk, see the <a href="background.html">workflow
backgrounder</a>; it's got a fairly good presentation of what workflow is and what it can do for you.
The beginnings of a new set of application examples are in <a href="examples/index.html">the wftk
application section</a>.  There, it should soon be more apparent what wftk really is.
<p>
There aren't many examples of application code yet, besides the command-line utilities wrapped around
the repmgr and the wftk core.  There is a popup window framework coming up which talks to the
repository manager, and there are the Python wrappers for embedding repmgr and the XMLAPI into Python
programs (a nice combination with Zope or wxWindows).  There will be more.
