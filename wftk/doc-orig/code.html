<h2>wftk: Design and implementation</h2>
[ <a href="index.html">wftk documentation home</a> ]
<hr>

The wftk is implemented as a library in ANSI C.  Under Windows, it is (optionally) a DLL, but
the Unix makefiles still just produce a static-link library.  Its internal data structures are
based on XML and use a library called the XMLAPI.  The XMLAPI library uses James Clark's expat
parser to read XML files and data; there's no reason you couldn't write a simple wrapper for
any other parser, though.  (But why would you want to?  Expat works!)
<p>
A wftk application is organized into the following levels:
<ul>
<li>The front end (e.g. thick client, Web server, etc.: the application)
<li>The core engine
<li>A series of <i>adaptors</i> through which wftk talks to other systems.
</ul>
<p>
As of July 2001, there is only one front end of a sort: the command-line wrapper, which is a
standalone C program which links to the wftk library.  Work has begun on a Python extension which
will allow the coding of front ends in Python (GUI work with wxPython, or Web work with Zope),
and similar front ends are planned for Perl, PHP, and Tcl (for AOLserver).
<p>
The adaptors fall into classes; each adaptor class addresses one kind of interaction with the
outside world.  Examples are message sending, datasheet storage, and database interaction.  Each
class has at least one adaptor implemented, and several have more than one (for example, there
are working database adaptors for ODBC and Oracle, and working datasheet storage adaptors for
the local filesystem and for arbitrary databases.)
<p>
There is now (July 28, 2001) the beginnings of a Python wrapper; to date, this consists of a
prety good wrapper for XMLAPI, the main library to follow.  Full Python integration will require
quite a bit of thought, as will integration with any scripting language.
<p>
The basic layout of the source code is as follows:
<ul>
<li><a href="../src/wftk/index.html">WFTK code (core engine and command-line wrapper)</a>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="../src/wftk/wftk_lib.html">Main library implementation (wftk_lib.xml)</a>
  <li><a href="../src/wftk/wftk_adaptors.html">Adaptor interface (wftk_adaptors.xml)</a>
  <li><a href="../src/wftk/wftk_config.html">Configuration interface (wftk_config.xml)</a>
  <li><a href="../src/wftk/wftk_util.html">Command-line interface (wftk_util.xml)</a>
  <li>(subdirectories): One subdirectory for each adaptor class.
  </ul>
<li><a href="../src/xmlapi/index.html">XMLAPI code</a>
<li><a href="../src/python/index.html">Python wrapper</a>
</ul>
