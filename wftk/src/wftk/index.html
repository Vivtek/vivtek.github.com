The wftk core library, defined here, is the core workflow functionality of the whole wftk system.  Everything
else just supports this stuff, basically.  It's implemented as a library so we can build it into other systems.
<p></p>
The library consists of: <ul>
<li> Basic workflow functions.
<li> The workflow procdef interpreter.
<li> Places to put adaptors.
</ul>

So, OK, that list is really short.  The reason is simple: wftk is built almost entirely on adaptors.  The core
engine, besides defining the interpreter used to figure out what comes next, is really just a wrapper API around
about ten adaptor classes, which define sets of functionality which can be defined in the context of whatever
else is going on in the system.<p></p>

<strong><font size=+1>Adaptors</font></strong><br>

The core engine uses the following adaptors (the links go to specific information):<ul>
<li> <code>action</code>: <a href="action/index.html">Action adaptors (encapsulation of other APIs)</a>.
<li> <code>datatype</code>: <a href="datatype/index.html">Data types</a>.
<li> <code>datastore</code>: <a href="datastore/index.html">Data stores</a>.
<li> <code>dsrep</code>: <a href="dsrep/index.html">Datasheet repository</a>.
<li> <code>pdrep</code>: <a href="pdrep/index.html">Procdef repository</a>.
<li> <code>perms</code>: <a href="perms/index.html">Permissions module</a>.
<li> <code>user</code>: <a href="user/index.html">User management module</a>.
<li> <code>taskindex</code>: <a href="taskindex/index.html">Task index</a> (really the indexing mechanism for processes and tasks both).
<li> <code>notify</code>: <a href="notify/index.html">Notification mechanisms</a>.
</ul>

The point of these adaptors is to create as flexible and modular a system as possible.  The
<a href="http://www.aolserver.com">AOLserver</a> database driver system has been a great influence on
me here -- with AOLserver it's almost trivial to write a database driver to allow seamless (well, ideally)
access to database functionality from scripts, and your scripts don't really change much if you have to
switch databases or port to a different system.  (Well, except that "standard" query language isn't, of course,
so there's still work to do when porting, but you get the idea.)
<p></p>
I'll explain briefly what each of those adaptor types does -- for more information, please follow
the individual links, where the precise functionality of each type is enumerated, and links are given
to actual implementations.
<p></p>  The <strong>datasheet repository</strong>,
for example, is where datasheets are stored.  The <strong>procdef repository</strong> is where process definitions are
stored.  In the prototype, each of these was implemented as a fairly simple system of files and
directories.  In the case of the procdef repository, however, there are already good solutions to things
like version control -- CVS is a good example.  Ideally, if CVS is available, the procdef repository
should be able to use it for "real" version control and also for all the integration possibilities
which are already there.  Thus the procdef repository is implemented as an adaptor.
<p></p>
Another motivating example, this one for the datasheet repository: in the vast majority of systems, we'll want
a general "processes" table.  Instead of keeping process information in two places (i.e. that table plus a
directory of XML files) it seems a lot more natural -- and will end up being much more stable and supportable --
to store the process datasheet as a BLOB right in the process table.  This is easily solved by exposing the
datasheet repository functionality as another adaptor and telling wftk to use that adaptor.  The upshot of the
adaptor concept is: if you have a better solution already in the system, then use it.  WFTK just wants to coordinate
it all so you can call it workflow.
<p></p>
The <strong>user</strong> and <strong>perms</strong> adaptors allow the core engine (and its CGI implementations) to ask a directory who the
current user is and what permissions the current user has.  Naturally, the <a href="../user/index.html">user
module</a> included with the wftk is the preferred one, if that's the right word, but once I've
learned something about LDAP I'm sure I'll want to integrate with it.  More to the point, if your
organization already has something in place that can do user authentication and permission
definitions, then wftk should work with it.  The permissions model for wftk has turned out to be a really interesting
affair, since it allows a three-way decision: actions may be permitted, denied, or deferred until an approval
process has been completed.  This is a sweet, elegant way to do things and I can't wait to actually apply it
somewhere.
<p></p>
The <strong>task index</strong> provides an interface to an index (basically a relational database). 
The overview talks about the difference between
core workflow and task management.  Suffice it to say here that the db adaptor allows us to specify a
set of databases to which current status of tasks and processes can be written so that other systems
can also use that information.  It's a little counterintuitive to think of process information in a task repository, but
the idea is that the task-centric viewpoint is what gives the adaptor type its name.
<p></p>
The <strong>notification adaptor</strong> provides a way to adapt wftk to existing messaging protocols.  I'm implementing
email and a database-based task manager notification methods, but you can easily imagine others, like
Outlook integration or alpanumeric pagers.
<p></p>
The <strong>action adaptor</strong> is going to be one of the most exciting parts of wftk.  Particularly once
I drop this engine into Python, it's going to be nice to be able to run Python snippets from inside a
process.  The same thing applies to Perl, Java, Tcl, or what have you.  (OK, Java might be a little
trickier since it's compiled.  I'll see how that all works out.)  The action adaptor also provides a place to
check permissions and interpose approval processes -- I'm not entirely sure yet how to balance these two
applications, and maybe I'm wrong to conflate them.  I'm uneasy about allowing scripting in ad-hoc workflow
without permissions, though, so I think that scripting mechanisms will probably be forced to undergo
permission checking -- with the idea that specific, permissible scripts may be installed to run with no
approval (because they're pre-approved.)
<p></p>
Likewise, the data manipulation facilities will be extensible via a <strong>datatype adaptor</strong>.  The details of
this (like the scripting adaptor) are pretty fuzzy at this point.
<p></p>
The <strong>datastore adaptor</strong> deserves a special mention, too.  The default storage for values is of course directly 
in the datasheet.  However, especially if we imagine a datasheet adaptor which stores datasheets into a process
table, we can easily imagine that we'd much rather have the value itself (or some of them) live directly in
the table.  Effectively the datavalue in the data sheet would be a pointer to this "real" store, and wftk
should be smart enough to update the table when the value is updated in the datasheet.  Thus the datastore
adaptor, which provides a means to tell wftk where things really are.  The datastore adaptor is turning out to be a
rather convenient integration tool.
<p></p>

<strong><font size=+1>Data sources used</font></strong><br>
Besides its commands, the engine has two sources of input: the process definition and the
datasheet.  The procdef stores information about a class of processes; the datasheet stores
information about the current instance of that class.  Both documents are XML documents, and
the core engine interprets these documents using James Clark's
<a href="http://www.vivtek.com/expat.html">expat parser</a>, a stable and fairly simple parser.
<p></p>
Commands can be performed either by calling individual action functions, or passing a <i>very</i>
simple list of commands in an XML format to a general command doer thingy function.
<p></p>

<strong><font size=+1>Where the code is</font></strong><br>
At any rate, the organization of this beast is starting to take shape.  Instead of developing everything in one
monolithic literate presentation, I found myself breaking everything down into smaller pieces:
<ul>
<li><a href="library.html">The library definition</a> is of course where the bulk of the code is.
<li><a href="wftk_config.html">The example config module</a> shows how config modules are built.
This example is just hardcoded at the moment, but new ones will be following soon, especially a Registry-based one
for the Windows environment.
<li><a href="wftk_adaptors.html">The adaptor handling code</a> is for some reason on its own page.  I'm still
not entirely sure why, but it made sense at the time.  It's got a little explanation of how adaptors are used.
<li><a href="wftk_util.html">The code for the command-line wftk utility</a> shows how to use all this stuff.  It's
still pretty thin, but it'll surely grow with time and nurturing.
</ul>

So that's it at the moment.  Sky's the limit.
