<hr>
Here are a few things that the library functions will use (and adaptor code as well) but that don't really need
to be exposed to the cold, hard world.  First are the IDs for the types of adaptor.  This will almost certainly end
up being a partial list.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>#define DSREP         1
#define DATASTORE     2
#define DATATYPE      3
#define PDREP         4
#define USER          5
#define PERMS         6
#define TASKINDEX     7
#define NOTIFY        8
#define ACTION        9
#define DEBUG_MSG    10

</pre></td></tr></table>

And the other is the definition of the WFTK_ADAPTOR structure used to pass APIs back and forth.  Sort of a poor
man's ActiveX, I guess.  See the <a href="wftk_adaptors.html">adaptor handling code</a> for a little more detail,
but the upshot is that the interface
to an adaptor is a kind of explicit vtable, and calls to adaptors all work through a single function.
<p></p>
For the case where we want a list of all the configured adaptors in a given class (like debug adaptors or task index
adaptors, both of which are notification-like affairs where everybody involved wants to get notified) we have an
adaptor list structure which can hold several adaptors.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>#ifndef WFTK_EXPORT
#define WFTK_EXPORT
#endif

typedef struct wftk_adaptor WFTK_ADAPTOR;
typedef XML * (*WFTK_API_FUNC) (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, va_list args);
struct wftk_adaptor {
   int num;                /* Supplied by the adaptor class. */
   XML * parms;            /* Supplied by the caller. */
   int  nfuncs;            /* Supplied by the adaptor class. */
   char ** names;          /* Supplied by the adaptor class. */
   WFTK_API_FUNC * vtab;   /* Supplied by the adaptor driver. */
   void * bindata;         /* Supplied by the adaptor driver (a general stash pointer.) */
   void * session;         /* Supplied by the config module on allocation. */
};
struct adaptor_info {
   int  nfuncs;
   char ** names;
   WFTK_API_FUNC * vtab;
};
typedef struct wftk_adaptorlist WFTK_ADAPTORLIST;
struct wftk_adaptorlist {
   int count; /* The number of adaptors in this list. */
   WFTK_ADAPTOR * ads[1];
};
</pre></td></tr></table>

Then we have the interface to the config module.  Lest this be missed (somehow), each installation of the wftk has a single
config module, which is static-linked in.  There will be variants, however, at least between Windows and Unix, as Unix
tends to favor precompiled directory locations, while Windows favors the Registry, because most users don't have a working
compiler.
<p></p>
There are two functions of interest; <code>config_get_value</code> gets a named value, and <code>config_debug_message</code>
passes a message to any installed debugging adaptors.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT const char * config_get_value (void * session, const char *name);
WFTK_EXPORT void config_debug_message (char type, const char * message, ...);
</pre></td></tr></table>

To make debugging simpler, and to make it go away when not in use so as to save space, we'll define a couple of debugging
macros to wrap around <code>config_debug_message</code>:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>#ifdef DEBUG
#define DBG(x,y) config_debug_message (x, y);
#define DBG1(x,y,z) config_debug_message (x, y, z);
#define DBG2(x,y,z,now) config_debug_message (x, y, z, now);
#else
#define DBG(x,y) ;
#define DBG1(x,y,z) ;
#define DBG2(x,y,z,now) ;
#endif
</pre></td></tr></table>

Prototypes for the adaptor functions, which are defined <a href="wftk_adaptors.html">here</a>.  The single-bore adaptor
calls may return XML values; the shotgun approach ones (list calls) are used for outgoing simultaneous notification to
multiple adaptors of a single class, so they don't return any value.  The integer is there ... I'm not sure why it's there,
but someday I might, in a fit of guilt, decide that an error return would be a good idea.
<p></p>
<i>(July 22, 2001)</i> The DSREP_database adaptor, which I'm compiling into a DLL, needs to load
the database adaptor specified -- so it needs the adaptor functions to be exported.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT WFTK_ADAPTOR * wftk_get_adaptor (void * session, int type, const char * name);
WFTK_EXPORT XML * wftk_call_adaptor (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, const char * funcname, ...);
WFTK_EXPORT void wftk_free_adaptor (void * session, WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad);
WFTK_EXPORT WFTK_ADAPTORLIST * wftk_get_adaptorlist (void * session, int type);
WFTK_EXPORT int wftk_call_adaptorlist (WFTK_ADAPTORLIST * ad, const char * funcname, ...);
WFTK_EXPORT void wftk_free_adaptorlist (void * session, WFTK_ADAPTORLIST * list);
</pre></td></tr></table>

We've got a couple of prototypes for functions that are supposed to be called only internally.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XML * _procdef_load (void * session, XML * datasheet);
const char * _wftk_value_special (void * session, XML * datasheet, const char * name);
</pre></td></tr></table>

And the internal definition of a wftk session.  The session is used to stash currently loaded adaptors. 
 This prevents us from having to (say) log into a database for
every wftk call.  If, however, no session is created, no harm done -- we'll just free each adaptor each time.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>typedef struct wftk_adaptor_list WFTK_ADAPTOR_LIST;
struct wftk_adaptor_list {
   WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad;
   WFTK_ADAPTOR_LIST *next;
};
typedef struct wftk_cache_list WFTK_CACHE_LIST;
struct wftk_cache_list {
   XML * cached;
   WFTK_CACHE_LIST * next;
};
typedef struct wftk_session WFTK_SESSION;
struct wftk_session {
   WFTK_ADAPTOR_LIST *ads;
   XML * user;
   XML * config;
   XML * datasheet;
   XML * procdef;

   XML * values;
   WFTK_CACHE_LIST * cache;
};
</pre></td></tr></table>
