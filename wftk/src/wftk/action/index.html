<hr>

An <i>action</i> uniquely describes something which the system is supposed to do.  An action may be performed immediately,
or the permissions configuration for the action may indicate that an approval process is required, in which case the action
is deferred.  Once the process completes, the action is actually performed.  Checking of permissions is not required of the
action handler, however; the action handler just has to <i>take</i> the action.  Think of an action handler as an API
encapsulation.
<p>
These are the functions exposed by an action handler adaptor:
<table>
<tr><td><i><u>Function</i></u></td><td><i><u>Parameters</i></u></td><td><i><u>Purpose</i></u></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=eeeeee><td valign=top>0: init</td>
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Initialize adaptor instance</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=ffffff><td valign=top>1: free</td>
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Clean up instance before shutting down</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=eeeeee><td valign=top>2: info</td>
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Return XML describing the adaptor</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=ffffff><td valign=top>3: do</td>
    <td valign=top>Action</td>
    <td>Performs the action</td></tr>
</table>

Individual adaptor class handlers may implement additional functions, which will then presumably
be available to scripting engines or something.

<p>
Implementations:<ul>
<li><a href="ACTION_wftk.html">ACTION_wftk</a> does things wftk-related by calling the library.
<li><a href="ACTION_system.html">ACTION_system</a>: calls the shell to execute things.
<li>(TO DO) ACTION_perl, e.g.: calls a scripting language to do things.  This will be most powerful when wftk is embedded
within that scripting language, of course.  Targets: Perl, Python, Tcl, Java.
</ul>
