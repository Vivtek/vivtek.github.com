A <i>notification method adaptor</i> is responsible for interfacing with a system used to notify
people or other agents about events.  This is really, really open-ended.  Obvious candidates
here are email and line-based logs, but syslogging is also a good possibility, or who knows
what?
<p>
These are the functions exposed by a notification method adaptor (well, OK, they're not there yet):
<table>
<tr><td><i><u>Function</i></u></td><td><i><u>Parameters</i></u></td><td><i><u>Purpose</i></u></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=eeeeee><td valign=top>0: init</td>
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Initialize adaptor instance</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=ffffff><td valign=top>1: free</td>
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Clean up instance before shutting down</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=eeeeee><td valign=top>2: info</td>
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Return XML describing the adaptor</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=ffffff><td valign-top>3: notify</td>
    <td valign=top>XML alert structure<br>Datasheet for interpretation of values (if any)</td>
    <td>Perform the notification</td></tr>
</table>

Implementations:<ul>
<li><a href="NOTIFY_smtp.html">NOTIFY_smtp</a> (connects to SMTP server to send email notifications)
<li>(TODO) NOTIFY_odbc (writes to a database)
<li>(TODO) NOTIFY_mapi (uses MAPI on Win32 to send email notifications)
<li>(TODO) NOTIFY_log (writes notifications to a log file)
<li>(TODO) NOTIFY_stdout (writes notifications to stdout, as in the prototype)
<li>Other possibilities would be integration with Outlook or something, probably.  Is that MAPI?
</ul>
