The process is one of the two dual central data structures of the workflow engine.  I've explained this here and there
anyway, but this is another good place to take another run at it.  Basically, the <i>process</i> represents something of
which the system is aware, while <i>tasks</i> represent things which have to be done in order to respond to that something.
Tasks may exist without processes, whenever individual people decide they want to keep track of things they have to do
which are effectively external to the workflow system.  Processes may exist without tasks, if nobody has to do anything
about whatever it is that the process represents.  Where I personally think that a number of workflow and workflow-like
systems go wrong is in assuming that one or the other representation is the "really central" viewpoint.
<p></p>
At any rate, the internal representation of a process is what I call a <i>datasheet</i>.  In the simplest of datasheet
repositories, these datasheets are simply stored as XML files in a directory.  More sophisticated repositories can build
the datasheets as needed after querying a database, for instance, but internally all we care about is the XML
representation.  The term "datasheet" arose when I was attacking the problem from the task viewpoint, and realized I needed
a central point of storage for arbitrary data values.  As this central point of storage was obviously also a good place to
store the process state, active tasks, and so forth, the datasheet became the process.
<p></p>
The wftk provides tools for both viewpoints and remains agnostic on points of theory.  The functions in the wftk API
which deal with processes are pretty straightforward.  We need to create them, load and save them, attach procdefs to
them, archive old ones, and delete unneeded ones.  Almost all this functionality is provided by the datasheet repository
adaptor, so these functions are short and sweet.

<p></p>
The functions for creation, load, and save are so straightforward I'll just lump them all together here.  Eh, come to
think of it, deletion is the same, so here it is, too.

Next is <code>wftk_process_define</code>, which attaches a procdef to a process.  The question may very well arise as to
exactly why this is necessary.  The answer may not satisfy some people, but it's simply that wftk supports the notion of
an <i>ad-hoc process</i>, which is basically a folder in which ad-hoc tasks may be grouped and which may also store arbitrary
values for those grouped tasks.  It has no real workflow functionality at all, so it needs no procdef.  In this mode,
the datasheet really is just a datasheet.
<p></p>
So for better or worse, we have to call two functions to set up a workflow process instead of one.  That just doesn't
seem like such a sacrifice to me.
<p></p>
The version call returns a little value holder XML, which is simply XML of the form <code>&lt;value value="something"&gt;</code>.  It's
a cheap little dodge.  The current XMLAPI is not good at all with buffer management, but it's still a closer approximation
to a heap than anything in native C, so I'm finding myself using it a lot.  Later I'll do a better job with it and that
will automagically improve the workflow engine.
<p></p>
It's been said that any sufficiently complex program implemented in C contains most of an
implementation of LISP.  (The implication being that you might as well save time and write
LISP to start with.)  I'm starting to believe this.  But I <i>still</i> think this code is
much more readable than the equivalent LISP would be, and I know it's more portable, too.

Here's a function to load the procdef version associated with a datasheet.  Again, it's largely a wrapper for
an adaptor.  This function isn't exposed by the API at all; it's an internal function.  I'll probably do a separate
procdef management API which will expose this sort of thing, plus checkin/checkout functionality and so forth.

Finally, in the API I've defined a function to be used to archive datasheets which are no longer needed.  I haven't
really thought this through, so I'm going to leave it pretty much undefined for the time being, or more specifically,
I'm going to assume that the individual adaptors have something coherent to offer here.  Intuitively I feel that this
is too simplistic, that there should be an archive adaptor or something, so maybe the "archive" parameter will specify
that.  But right now I don't want to deal with it.

   if (!ret) {
      wftk_free_adaptor (session, ad);

<i>(March 31, 2000)</i>  OK, as of now, things are getting funky.  The <code>wftk_process_adhoc</code> function takes
an arbitrary piece of workflow script and attaches it to a process.  This code is stored in the process, not in a procdef,
and it runs right from there.  To make the location stay constant, we need a couple of rules.  First, every ad-hoc code
segment is in an <code>adhoc</code> tag.  Second, an <code>adhoc</code> tag may never be deleted (because the location
finder runs on numeric position in the datasheet).  Third, once activated, ad-hoc code may not be changed, otherwise the
queue will no longer reflect the code being run, and that would be bad.  Other than that, this is easy stuff, but with
very powerful consequences.
<p></p>
Besides just being normal workflow, ad-hoc snippets can do two things upon completion: they can first change the status of
the process by having an "oncomplete" attribute (so that ad-hoc workflow to recover from an error state is simple to set up),
and they can also fill in for a task, so that when the snippet completes, the task is also completed.  That makes ad-hoc
workflow convenient for subplanning without the overhead of explicit subprocesses.
