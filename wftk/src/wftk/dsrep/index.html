A <i>datasheet repository adaptor</i> is responsible for interfacing with a storage system in order
to store datasheets.  The datasheet, as far as the library is concerned, is an XML construct
which contains the detailed state of a process, any values associated with it, and its
enactment history.  Where those components are actually stored are irrelevant for the library;
finding them and putting them together are the business of the datasheet repository adaptor.
<p>
The simplest of all possible dsrep adaptors, of course (and the one which was used for the
prototype, again of course) is one which stores all the datasheets as explicit XML files
in a central directory.  That's the DSREP_localxml adaptor.  Other dsrep adaptors will store
the datasheet in a BLOB column of the process table, borrowed from a task adaptor, or what
have you.  I'm sure each implementation of a workflow system will bring new ideas to light.

These are the functions exposed by a datasheet repository adaptor:

<tr><td><i><u>Function</i></u></td><td><i><u>Parameters</i></u></td><td><i><u>Purpose</i></u></td></tr>

    <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>

<tr bgcolor=ffffff><td valign=top>1: free</td>

    <td>Clean up instance before shutting down</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=eeeeee><td valign=top>2: info</td>
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Return XML describing the adaptor</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=ffffff><td valign=top>3: new</td>
    <td valign=top>Datasheet ID</td>
    <td>Create datasheet.  Accepts NULL ID, in which case it generates a unique one.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=eeeeee><td valign=top>4: load</td>
    <td valign=top>Datasheet ID</td>
    <td>Load datasheet into memory.  Returns datasheet.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=ffffff><td valign=top>5: save</td>
    <td valign=top>Datasheet XML structure</td>
    <td>Save datasheet.  Note that the ID might not be unique, because we might be storing
        or moving an existing one.  In this case, we need to fail.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=eeeeee><td valign=top>6: delete</td>
    <td valign=top>Datasheet ID</td>
    <td>Deletes datasheet from the repository.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=ffffff><td valign=top>7: archive</td>
    <td valign=top>Datasheet ID, archive name</td>
    <td>Archives a datasheet (removes it from the active repository and does something
        as yet unknown with it.)</td></tr>
</table>

Individual adaptor class handlers may implement additional functions, which will then presumably
be available to scripting engines or something.  (Who knows, at this rate, wftk will be primarily
useful as a scripting language lingua franca.)

<p>
Implementations:<ul>
<li><a href="DSREP_localxml.html">DSREP_localxml</a> (stores XML files in local directory)
<li>(TO DO) DSREP_taskrep (stores BLOBs in a task repository, i.e. a database).
</ul>
