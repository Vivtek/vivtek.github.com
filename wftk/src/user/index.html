Whoops, sorry.  This "module", if it can be called that, was much more involved in the
prototype.  In the pre-production version, the localxml user adaptor just uses files in
a local directory, one file per user, to do user information storage.  I'll document this
as soon as I can.

In the meantime, sorry for the broken link.
