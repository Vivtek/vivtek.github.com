<h2>PyWFTK: wftk workflow manipulation in Python</h2>
<hr>
OK, this is the homepage for the subproject PyWFTK, which is a set of Python wrappers for the
<a href="http://www.vivtek.com/wftk.html">wftk workflow toolkit</a>.  To date (August 2001) I've
managed to write a wrapper for the <a href="../xmlapi/index.html">XMLAPI</a> XML manipulation
library.  There was a sneaky little bug in there for a while, but I finally flushed it out
with the help of the kind folks at python-help.  They're cool people.
<p></p>
So anyway, there (will be) two parts to this wrapper.  The first is the aforementioned XMLAPI
wrapper, and the second is the wrapper for the wftk library itself.  You may ask (as others have)
why I don't simply use the native Python XML functionality -- the answer is simple: the XMLAPI
is effectively a dual-ported library.  That is to say, the structures are equally accessible from
Python code or from C code.  The entire wftk library is built on the C XMLAPI, so there would be
little point in changing it to be more Python-based.
<p></p>
That said, I <i>would</i> like to use Python's internal expat binding as opposed to linking in my own,
for instance, and I'd like to use Python's memory management routines, too.  You'll see the beginnings
of support for that in the code, but I've got a lot to do still before it will all work.  But -- bit by
bit, the wftk is getting close to Python-readiness!
<p></p>
There are, as I said, two parts to this wrapper.  The first is working, the second is vapor.
<ul>
<li><a href="py_xmlapi.html">The XMLAPI wrapper -- works like a charm.</a>
<li>The wftk wrapper itself -- not there yet.
</ul>

Thanks and keep checking back.  <a href="mailto:wftk@vivtek.com">Bug me</a> if you have an urgent need
for this stuff.
