It's sort of silly to have this little function hanging around on its own page, but it doesn't
really fit in anywhere else all that well.  It's pretty obvious how this thing works, isn't
it?  You start at the bottom of the stack, and print location pieces as you move to the top.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>void print_stack()
{
   FRAME * cur;
   for (cur = stack.next; cur != NULL; cur = cur->next) {
      if (cur != stack.next) printf (".");
      printf ("%s", cur->name);
      if (cur->offset_in_parent > 0) {
         printf ("(%d)", cur->offset_in_parent);
      }
   }
   printf ("\n");
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
