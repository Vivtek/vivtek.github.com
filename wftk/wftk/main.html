The structure of the program file is the same as any single-file C program: <code>#include</code>
directives, followed by declarations, followed by the main program.  A literate presentation is
<p></p>
So let's go ahead and define our <code>#include</code>s, shall we?
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;malloc.h>
#include &lt;stdarg.h>
#include &lt;string.h>
#include "xmlparse.h"
#include "localdefs.h"
void output (char type, const char *format, ...);
</pre></td></tr></table>

The <code>localdefs.h</code> file contains whatever local definitions a particular wftk
installation needs: particularly the locations of the process definition repository and the
datasheet repository (remember that in this version both of these are simply directories in
the local filesystem, but that later we'll have much more flexible options for both locations.)

Next we define all our data structures and helper functions.  XML and expat are rather core
to this.  Under the rubric of "XML" we'll define our central XML data structures and the
functions we'll use to work with them.  The use of the expat parser to parse XML text into
these structures will be in a separate section because it's not trivial.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre><i>See <a href="xml_stuff.html">In-memory XML data structures and functionality</a></i>
<i>See <a href="expat.html">xml_read: Using expat to parse XML files into memory</a></i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

Next up, let's look at how we will read our command input, and how we'll create our output.
Commands will be read from the command line or from a command stream and placed into a linked
list of command objects.  This will enhance the usability of this code in other projects, I
hope.  It'll also make it easy to write a different parsing front end for the interpreter.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre><i>See <a href="command_input.html">The command stack and how to load it</a></i>
<i>See <a href="output.html">Our oh-so-complex output stream</a></i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

Now we're getting close to the main program: let's define our globals.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre><i>See <a href="globals.html">Global variables: state</a></i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

All the underpinnings out of the way, now we can look at the command interpreter.
The interpreter is broken into two parts -- really two interpreters.  The entire process
is driven by the command stack, but the commands on that stack drive the real work of
interpretation, which is doing whatever the procdef tells us to do.  Execution state is
contained in the datasheet, so that it can be reloaded between runs.  (Thus the datasheet
represents persistent storage implemented via XML -- lots of buzzwords in that!)
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre><i>See <a href="run_procdef.html">Interpreting the process definition</a></i>
<i>See <a href="interpreter.html">Interpreting command streams</a></i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

And hey!  Just as you were losing hope, there's some code in this item after all!
Not much, granted, but all it has to do is to read the command from the command line,
use that to initialize the command stack, and then call the interpreter on the command
stack.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
   <i>See <a href="globals.html#init">Initializing global variables from the command line</a></i>

   interpret (command_stack);

   xml_free (datasheet);
   xml_free (procdef);
   return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br><br>
<a name="print_usage">
<i>Print usage description</i><br>
Here is as good a place as any to define the text we'll print if the command line doesn't
suit us.  There's not much that will offend us, I'm sure.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>printf ("usage: wftk &lt;command> &lt;arguments>\n");
printf ("  Commands:\n");
printf ("  start &lt;process id> &lt;procdef>\n");
printf ("  activate &lt;process id> &lt;locator> &lt;task id>\n");
printf ("  complete &lt;process id> &lt;task id>\n");
printf ("  reject &lt;process id> &lt;task id>\n");
printf ("  setvalue &lt;process id> &lt;name> &lt;type> &lt;file> or value on stdin\n");
printf ("  settaskvalue &lt;process id> &lt;task id> &lt;name> &lt;type> &lt;file> or value on stdin\n");
printf ("  script &lt;process id> &lt;file> or command list on stdin\n");
</pre></td></tr></table>
