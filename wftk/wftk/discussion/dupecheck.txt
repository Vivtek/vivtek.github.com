Michaelwftk@vivtek.comwftk core engine discussion groupLet it be known that this bulletin board is kind of a stopgap. I'll be installing much better communication features, um, real soon now. Heh. <P>Seriously, I *do* intend to improve discussion mechanisms at some point. In the meantime I want to be sure that I have everything where I can get to it, so I'm hosting it here. <P>This particular discussion area is supposed to be about the core engine itself. For overall workflow discussion, there's a separate wftk board. I don't really care too much whether things stay on-topic.
