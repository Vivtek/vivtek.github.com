</ul>

This page is a central point for the wftk code documentation.  Some explanation is in order.
The wftk is coded in a <i>literate style</i>, which means that the source code and
its documentation are maintained together.  The source files are XML documentation which are
processed by means of my little tool <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/lpml.html>LPML</a>, which is
a Perl script and is included in the wftk distribution.  I plan to replace it with a C tool
so that no external dependence on Perl exists for a build, but that point hasn't come yet.
<p>
The wftk itself is embodied in a library which is implemented in ANSI C.  It relies
very heavily on in-memory structures which are based on XML (and these structures are naturally
thus always writable as XML).  The library which manipulates those is the XMLAPI and is documented
<a href="xmlapi/index.html">here</a>.
<p>
The code for the wftk library is <a href="wftk/index.html">here</a>.  The way it works is that
the core library defines the workflow API and implements the basic logic, while all interaction
with other systems is put into what I call <i>adaptors</i>.  An adaptor encapsulates everything
the wftk needs to know about a system (for instance, a datasheet storage repository, where
process information is kept).  Then you can implement an adaptor which talks to any arbitrary
system, and the wftk should work transparently with it.
<p>
Adaptors fall into classes, and each class has its own subdirectory in the main wftk code
directory, so you can browse around to see what I mean.
<p>
Included with the wftk_lib library is also a rudimentary command-line interface to allow you
to do things from the shell.  It doesn't expose the full wftk API, though.  Too much work to
think it through.
