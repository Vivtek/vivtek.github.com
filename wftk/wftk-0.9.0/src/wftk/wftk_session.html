<hr>
The whole session functionality has grown up over the last month or so into something a lot more ambitious than I'd intended.
Some of the wftk functionality will work with no session -- that is, if you give it a NULL value.  But as I'm not testing that
mode, I don't recommend you trust it too far.  You're likely to end up with memory leaks at the best, as the session, among other
things, is charged with maintaining, well, pretty much a heap.  A not-very-well-designed heap, but a heap.
<p></p>
The most obvious thing to do with sessions is to establish one and to free one.  Freeing is a touchy thing, because there are all
kinds of things that wftk stashes in the session, and they all have to be freed <i>if</i> they've been created.

The session was originally supposed to hold just the currently used datasheet and procdef, to simplify freeing them up and to avoid
loading them again and again.  But then I realized it's also the only logical place to store the configuration.  So without a session,
you can't have a configuration and you're thrown onto the precompiled values for repository directories and such.  Frankly, it probably
won't work.  If you're brave and really want a rock-bottom wftk configuration, though, give it a shot.  Just don't expect me to come
pick up the pieces.

<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>

{
   WFTK_SESSION * sess = session;
   sess->config = config;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

The <code>wftk_session_current</code> call associates a workflow object (in XML format) with the current session so that
subsequent calls to the library needn't look the object up again.  Ideally this should be transparent.  That makes freeing
up these objects somewhat confusing -- if you're not using a session, you have to do it yourself; otherwise, the session will
track things for you.  This stuff is going to be replaced with a better caching mechanism.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>void wftk_session_current (void * session, XML * object)
{
   WFTK_SESSION * sess = session;

   if (!session) return;
   if (!object) return;

   if (!strcmp (object->name, "datasheet")) {
      sess->datasheet = object;
      return;
   }
   if (!strcmp (object->name, "procdef")) {
      sess->procdef = object;
      return;
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

The cache mechanism is kind of weird.  You build an XML element and set a couple of attributes.  This element is now a cache key.
Toss it at the cache, and it will either match completely, in which case the key is discarded and the cached XML is returned, or
it won't, in which case the key is cached as a new structure and you can do with it what you will.  This is probably a dangerous
way of doing things, because if you have a wftk daemon running you've got no good way to clean up the cache or time things out or
really do anything.  So (yet again) this would be a good place to start looking post-v1.0 for things to do.  Sigh.  I can tell that
workflow is going to take the rest of my life.
<p></p>
The <code>wftk_session_cachecheck</code> function (get it?) checks for the key but doesn't delete it or cache it, either way.  This
is used to determine whether we're going to need to read something from the filesystem or not.  (In that case, if read, the parser
will return a brand-new XML structure, so it wouldn't be the same one as the key which got cached.  Not practical.)

The <code>wftk_session_setuser</code> creates a user structure and assigns the given userid to it.  More will certainly
be done with this later.  This function is not intended to include authentication of the userid.  The <code>wftk_session_getuser</code>
just returns the user structure with no further ado.  Of course, the caller may then change said structure (providing a
way to do that authentication.)

   if (sess->user) { xml_free (sess->user); }

   sess->user = xml_create ("user");
   xml_set (sess->user, "id", userid);
}
XML * wftk_session_getuser (void *session)
{
   WFTK_SESSION * sess = session;

<i>(April 11, 2001)</i> Stashing values in the session is just about the only logical way to handle alternate datastores.
The way this works is that the session is given a (character pointer) value to stash.  It wraps a value XML around that,
thereby copying the value, and tucks that away for later freeing.  Then it returns the value XML.
<p></p>

Later, the calling application has the option of freeing up the value for performance's sake (or leaving it there for
cleanup with the session for simplicity's sake.)  We do that by scanning the values <i>by pointer</i> and deleting the
one found (if found).  If we don't find the pointer, we do nothing.  This is C the way it should be (YMMV).

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XML * wftk_session_stashvalue (void * session, const char * value)
{
   WFTK_SESSION * sess = session;
   XML * holder;

   if (!sess->values) sess->values = xml_create ("list");

   holder = xml_create ("value");
   xml_set (holder, "value", value);
   xml_append (sess->values, holder);

   return holder;
}

void wftk_session_freevalue (void * session, const char * value)
{
   WFTK_SESSION * sess = session;
   ATTR * attribute;
   XML * pointer = xml_firstelem (sess->values);

   while (pointer) {
      attribute = pointer->attrs;
      while (attribute) {
         if (attribute->value == value) {
            xml_delete (pointer);
            return;
         }
         attribute = attribute->next;
      }
      pointer = xml_nextelem (pointer);
