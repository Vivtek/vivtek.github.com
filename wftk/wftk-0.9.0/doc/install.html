<strong>This is out of date.</strong>  But I want to get this out in beta for those of you chomping
at the bit.  I'll fix things up as soon as I can.
<p>

As of version v0.5 (October 2000) there are very few tools for wftk installation.  OK, there
are <i>no</i> tools for wftk installation.  You're on your own, in other words.  Also, all
we have is an AOLserver version of the task manager, so you'll need AOLserver.  At this
point I'm not even compatible with the current version of AOLserver; I'm still on v2.1
because I've been working so hard on wftk that I haven't had time to upgrade.  So it's
your fault.  Anyway, assuming you have AOLserver v2.1 installation media, here's how to
set up the wftk:

<ol>
<li><b>Unzip or untar</b> the wftk archive.  On Windows, with v0.5, this <i>must</i> be in the <code>c:\wftk</code>
    directory if you're going to use the precompiled code.
<li>If you're compiling (i.e. Unix or you're a Windows renegade), <b>update the localdefs.h</b>
    file in the include directory to point to your installation path.<br>
    If you're compiling with MSVC under Windows, <b>update MSVC.BAT</b> in the top directory to
    point to your MSVC directories.  If you want to build a workspace and project files,
    feel free to contribute them back to the project, but I'm not going to mess with them.
<li>If you're compiling, <b>compile</b> by running <code>make</code> in the three C-language directories.
    Sorry for the redundancy; I'll fix this kind of thing up in v1.0 or so.  Under Windows,
    run <code>build.bat</code> in each directory instead of running make.  You'll need Perl in this
    case, or modify <code>build.bat</code> to eliminate the call to LPML.
<li><b>Install AOLserver</b> from the media.  If you've already got AOLserver installed, skip this
    step and the next one.
<li>Using the AOLserver admin tool on port 9876 of your box (by default) <b>add a virtual
    server</b>.  This will be your wftk server.
<li>If you're running Windows, <b>set up an ODBC datasource</b> named wftk.  If you want,
    use the <code>wftk.mdb</code> in the top-level directory.  This probably won't scale terribly well,
    but it's a nice way to get your feet wet.
<li>Point the <b>pageroot</b> of the virtual server to the top-level directory of your installation.<br>
    Point the <b>tclroot</b> of the virtual server to the <code>taskmgr</code> directory.<br>
    Configure your <b>database</b> information.  Get ready to debug queries if you're not running
    PostgreSQL or Access/ODBC.<br>
    <b>Add the proper CGI extension</b> for the CGI components; I'm using <code>.cgi</code> under
    Unix and of course it must be <code>.exe</code> under Windows.<br>
    Here's an excerpt from my (Windows) <code>nsd.ini</code> for this server:
    <blockquote><code><pre>
[ns/server/server1]
DirectoryFile=index.html, index.htm, index.shtml
PageRoot=c:\wftk

[ns/server/server1/cgi]
Map=GET /*.exe
Map=POST /*.exe

[ns/server/server1/db]
Pools=*
DefaultPool=wftk

[ns/server/server1/module/nssock]
Port=80
Hostname=phobos

[ns/server/server1/tcl]
Library=c:\wftk\taskmgr
</pre></code></blockquote>
   Do the same for your virtual server and you can't go wrong.
<li>If you haven't already, restart AOLserver to get it to load those definitions.
<li>You'll want to <b>configure AOLserver's permissions</b> to keep hands off of POST requests; by default, all POSTs are
    marked as password-only by AOLserver.  Since our POST CGIs already handle permissions, we don't need AOLserver to
    meddle.  So do this:<ul>
    <li> Go to the AOLserver admin page at [server]/NS/Admin.
    <li> Select the Access Control link.
    <li> Select the "Show All Records" link (that's in the fourth group of links down there)
    <li> Find the record for POST / and select that.
    <li> Select No restriction on users and No restriction on groups.  Update.
    </ul>
<li>Under Windows, find the DLLs in the <code>expat/bin</code> directory and <b>copy them to windows\system</b>.
</ol>

Now you should be ready to start.  You'll want to set up some users and groups to reflect
your organization; the default user admin/admin is there already.
<p>
Let me know where the holes are in these instructions.  (Thanks to the guys at <a href=http://www.consotec.de>Consotec</a>
for finding the first one; I had neglected to document my fix to the permissions.)
