<h2>Overview report</h2>

<hr>

To be perfectly honest, I don't think it makes a lot of sense to hand-compose a bunch of HTML to describe reports.
Here are some reports which seem reasonable to include in the system out of the box; I'd like to hear some more:

<ul>
<li>For the supervisor of a group, a list of all active tasks along with age of the task.  Sort by person, or by age.  Gives
an overview of how quickly things are getting done.  I wouldn't mind a reference to some metrics, if anybody knows any.

<li>For the supervisor, a list of all active processes which <i>may</i> end up creating an active task for somebody in the
group before completing.  This would simply look at the roles defined for each process currently active, and show all
those for which the group is included in one of the roles.  Note that just because a role is defined doesn't automatically
mean that the task will ever get activated; it could very well be in a conditional, for instance.

<li>For the system administrator I can imagine a number of useful reports, such as traffic, active processes overall,
and so on.  That probably belongs under the System Admin tab, but it's a blurry area.

</ul>
