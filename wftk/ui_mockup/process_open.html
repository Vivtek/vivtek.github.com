<h2>Open process definition</h2>
<font size=-1><i>
Here, you'll be able to select a process for editing.  Probably a good default display would
be of projects you yourself own, but the document management system will have to have a system
of permissions which will allow you to edit other people's processes if granted permission.
For scalability, I figure a folder system will be necessary.  I've sketched a kind of folder
system below, but my creativity for examples is not particularly convincing at the moment.
