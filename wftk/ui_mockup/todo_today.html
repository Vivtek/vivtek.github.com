<h2>Today's to do list</h2>
<font size=-1><i>
Today's to do list would be all tasks which by <i>projected time</i> would be completed
today.  This list would change as the day progresses and tasks are completed.  I don't really
care for this, as I'd really like to do some more comprehensive to-do list management.
Does anyone have any suggestions?
