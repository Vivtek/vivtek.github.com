    <b>Perl tutorial</b>: Now that I have a small subset of the data services
written in Perl, I've started writing unit tests -- for the simple reason that
I can't remember what I've already done, and I worry about breaking it.  From
the unit tests, I'm writing example code (or rather, the other way around),
and I'm organizing the example code into a <a href=perl_tutorial/>tutorial</a>.  This is
kind of exciting, actually.

   can't base a wftk server on Java (e.g. Tomcat), you <i>can</i> run wftk as a

   <b>Real development again</b>:
    June and July were very busy months, and August even more so:
   in June, I developed (for pay) a <b>wxPython GUI demo program</b> which
  I will soon be cleaning up and making available for download.  I also
  have an initial <b>SOAP adaptor</b> which allows arbitrary Web service
  interfacing from a running workflow process.  (The Python wrapper allows
  the exposure of wftk functionality as a Web service, but I don't have an
  example working yet.)  I completed the long-awaited <b>repmgr/wftk core
  integration</b> which has been holding me up for so long.  And finally,
  I am <b>off to Germany tomorrow</b> for a real live consulting trip, in
  the course of which an initial <b>JNI wrapper</b> will be written, as
  the first step in the <b>wftk-j plan</b>.
  <br><br>
  <i>Note:</i> none of the stuff I mention above is available for download yet,
  since I've been far too busy actually getting it all to work in the first place,
  but hopefully I'll have time in Germany to roll it all up into a new
   release.  If not, it'll be shortly after that -- in September for sure.
  If you're really, really chomping at the bit, email me.  I respond well
  to attention.
  <br><br>
   I really thought a Zope interface would come more quickly than the JNI
   wrapper.  Go figure.

   OK, here's the situation.  I really want to close off a version 1.0 for the core workflow engine so that
   I can have some sense of closure before going on to integrate the repository manager with the workflow engine.
   And I really wanted to get that done in May, and so I defined the cutoff point in my mind to be that point where
   I can define a datasheet DTD and not have to change it greatly in the coming months.  And I got to that point!
   But then I realized that I really want to add a <a href=doc/background.html>state-based workflow paradigm</a>
   to the core engine before I
   call it version 1.0, and so that's what I'm doing now.  Just another solid day or two worth of work and I'll
   release it.  Everything but state-based workflow is available on CVS.  Once I have things working with state-based
   workflow, I'll wrap up a tarball, submit the whole thing to Freshmeat, and see what happens.  And immediately
   continue work on version 1.1 or 1.5 or whatever.

   The wftk now works well with Oracle, the first of several database adaptors I hope to write in the near future.  I've got
   CVS working at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wftk/">the Sourceforge project page</a>, and my current code is in
   there.  Please be warned: my current code is a holy terror of a mess.  There are obsolete files all over the place.  So take
   it all with a grain of salt.
   <p>
   For Windows users, I've worked out dynamic loading of adaptors (I'm already familiar with how DLLs work -- getting dynaloading
   working on Unix will take some work).  This means that seldom-used adaptors (say, the ODBC adaptor if you're running Oracle)
   don't clutter things up.  This will move to Unix as well as soon as I screw my courage up to implement it.
   <p>
   On the horizon: Integration with Zope and with ColdFusion.  Database adaptors for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Sybase.  Perl
   integration ("use Workflow;") and a CPAN module.  Python integration (that's part of the Zope integration, of course.)

<div class="title">PROJECT</div>
</p><p>
  The wftk (open-source workflow toolkit) is a workflow engine in library form which can be integrated with whatever you need
  to integrate with.  It's designed on a very flexible <i>adaptor</i> architecture, whereby interfaces to external functionality
  are defined and implemented as independently as possible of the core workflow logic.  It makes heavy use of XML, so that its
  data structures are always easily inspected.  All it lacks (soon to be rectified) is experience in Real Life.
</p><p>
<div class="title">DOWNLOAD</div>
</p><p>
  Current versions can always be downloaded <a href=download.html>here</a>.  If you're into archaeology you can also take a
  look at the <a href="prototype.html">prototype</a>.
  <p> 
</p><p>
<div class="title">DOCUMENTATION</div>
</p><p>
  The documentation is still being written, but you can <a href="doc/index.html">see
  what I've done so far</a> -- and I'd appreciate any feedback or comments you
  may have.
</p><p>
  Of particular interest are the following headings:<ul>
   <li><a href="doc/overview.html">An overview of the wftk system</a>.
   <li><a href="doc/background.html">A backgrounder on workflow and wftk</a> (sort of a white paper, recently revised.)
   <li><a href="doc/examples/index.html">Examples of wftk applications</a>
   <li><a href="doc/code/index.html">The source code in literate-programming form</a>
   <li><a href="doc/programming/index.html">The start of the API programming documentation -- incomplete.</a>
  </ul>
</p><p>
<div class="title">YET TO DO</div>
</p><p>
  This version of the project home page is really just to show that I'm alive and that the beta is available.  This is what
  I still have to do in the very near future:
  <ul>
   <li>Get the "real" domains installed and ready: wftk.com and wftk.org.  They're bought and paid for.
   <li>Write CGI interfaces to everything.  This won't be too hard.  At the moment, however, there is no HTML interface
       to the current version, and that's just not particularly acceptible.
   <li>Set up a new demo system based on the new code.
   <li>Rewrite the procdef manager code to be library-based.  Additionally that will be used to present and work with ad-hoc
       workflow.
   <li>Document what the heck I've done here.  The docs are thin, people, real thin.
   <li>Integrate with Zope.
   <li>Integrate with PostgreSQL and MySQL (both actual requests).
   <li>Get a few implementation projects under my belt so I can call this a v1.0 production release.
  </ul>
</p><p>
  I'd like to talk to you about that last point.  Presumably you're interested in implementing a workflow system of some kind,
  otherwise you wouldn't be here.  Give me a shot.  I can do a limited number of free-of-charge consultations or even
  implementations; I'd be happy, given telnet/ssh access, to do some debugging in your environment, and of course if you want
  to hire me, I'm very attentive.  I've got a couple of leads on implementation projects already and I'd really like to add
  yours to the list.  I really want to see wftk work <i>right</i>, and concrete project implementations are the only way to
  make that work.
</p><p>
  <a href=mailto:wftk@vivtek.com>Mail me</a> if you're interested.  My schedule is, um, regularity-challenged, to say the least,
  so if you want to do the voice thing, set up a time to call, if you would.
</p><p>
<div class="title">WHERE I'M GOING<br>WITH THIS</div>
</p><p>
Besides just "plain workflow" I'm extremely interested in integrating wftk as an internal module in other systems.  The Zope
community has expressed a need for workflow functionality, and I'll be working on that in the near future.  Another possibility
which has occurred to me is that it'd be nice to use wftk as an organized means of approval for changes in database information.
I can easily see wftk being set up as a set of PostgreSQL triggers -- thus any UPDATE command would be converted into a request
for a change, which wftk would manage until approval was granted and the change actually made.  Workflow is a very powerful idea,
and I think that the absence of any open-source workflow engine (until now!) has precluded serious thought as to how powerful
it can be.
</p><p>
Anyway, that's a taste.  I'm also looking at what it'll take to port the engine into a parallel Java/EJB implementation.  Film at
11.
