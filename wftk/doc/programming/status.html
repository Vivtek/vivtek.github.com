<h3>Status</h3>
The status (or state) of a process, you would think, is a simple thing.  It's not.  The status of a
process is a string, which may be "active", "complete", or any other arbitrary value.  The "complete"
value has special meaning, of course, and when status is set to complete, a task index has the option
of deleting the process entry, a datasheet repository may archive the datasheet, and so forth.  But
just as importantly, different <i>implicit tasks</i> may be exposed depending on the status of the
process.  The most important of the implicit tasks is "!start", which allows a newly defined process
to start its defined workflow up.  (The reason workflow isn't started immediately upon definition, of
course, is that initial data may be required, and the list of required data is available only after
the process is defined.)
<p>
At any rate, even though the status of the process is stored in the datasheet XML, you need to use
these functions to get or set that value, just in case the wftk needs to do something along the way.

<h3>Functions</h3>
<pre>
const char * wftk_status_get (void * session, XML * datasheet);
int    wftk_status_set (void * session, XML * datasheet, const char *status);
</pre>

<h3>Details</h3>
<a name="wftk_status_get"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_status_get</font> returns <code>const char *</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * datasheet</code>
</blockquote>
Returns a pointer to the current status of the process.  This is a
string.  Special values include "start" and "complete".

<br><br>

<a name="wftk_status_set"></a>
<font size=+1>wftk_status_set</font> returns <code>int</code>
<blockquote>
<code>void * <a href="session.html">session</a>,</code><br>
<code>XML * datasheet</code>,<br>
<code>const char * status</code>
</blockquote>
Sets the status of a process.  Specially meaningful values are acted
upon by the wftk (like 'complete').
