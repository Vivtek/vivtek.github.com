<h2>Programmer's Guide to the wftk -- core workflow API</h2>
[ <a href="../index.html">wftk documentation home</a> ]
<hr>

<h3>Overview</h3>
The wftk core API is the set of C-language routines you can call from your code, assuming you're
working in some language that can deal with calling C-language routines.  Under Windows, these are
contained in the wftk or wftk_rt DLLs (depending on which runtime library you link against).  Under
Unix you generally static-link to the wftk.
<p>
If you're using the <a href="repmgr.html">repository manager</a>
(and if you're not, you're in wild and unexplored territory)
then there's an excellent chance you are in the wrong place in looking at the wftk core API, and
you might just want to let the repository manager take care of workflow for you.  But if you're
pretty sure you want to talk to the core API yourself, that's what you'll find here.
<p>
This API is roughly object-oriented, making it relatively easy to embed in an object-oriented language.
Notes on the class structure planned for the wftk are <a href="../classes.html">here</a>.  These classes
are more or less language-agnostic, in that they will be substantially identical whether you're writing
Python, Java, or C++.
<p>
In the wftk core, a process is represented by a <i>datasheet</i>.  Internally, the datasheet is an XML 
document, which you manipulate using the <i>XMLAPI</i> library, a DOM-like set of functions which
build and modify heap-based data structures based on XML (and which can be written to and read from
actual XML files on disk or elsewhere.)  I say, "internally," because you could easily write an adaptor
which would talk to some other non-XML-based system to load a datasheet; that adaptor would build an
XMLAPI structure which would be equivalent to the standard XML file used in the stock adaptor.
<p>
The datasheet contains values (hence its name), it maintains a queue of tasks and bookmarks into
active workflows, it contains an enactment history of the process, and it will probably end up doing
more as time goes on.  In a very real sense, then, even though the users' activities focus on tasks
more than on processes, your programming will focus on processes.
<p>
<h3>Data structures</h3>
<i>All</i> data structures for the wftk are built as internal XML objects using the XMLAPI.
These are the various things you will encounter while working with the wftk:
<ul>
<li>Datasheets
<li>Process definitions (procdefs)
<li>Task objects
<li>Request objects
<li>User objects
<li>Notification (alert) objects
<li><a href="xml_list.html">List (query) objects</a>
</ul>
Obviously, a major shortcoming of the current documentation is the absence of definitions for
any of these.  I need to comb through the code to reconstruct them, so it'll be a few days yet.
Caveat: "a few days" in my personal universe means it may or may not be this year.
Bear with me.  I never actually stop working on the wftk, I just get distracted sometimes.
<p>

Granted, some of those categories are pretty peripheral, but that's the API as it stands right now.

<h3>Examples</h3>
For now, you can look at the code in the command-line utility, but at some point I want to snip some
working bits of code out as examples.  Most importantly, there are a couple of ways to use wftk that
you probably aren't thinking of -- for instance, you can use it as a permission system for arbitrary
actions using the <code>wftk_action</code> function.  (You can grant or revoke full permission or
cause the action to start an approval process; after approval, wftk will automatically complete the
action.)  WFTK -- it's not just for breakfast anymore.
