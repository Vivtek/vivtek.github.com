<h3>Lists</h3>

Lists, and by extension queries, are represented rather simply in the wftk: they consist of an 
XML element of type "list" which contains any number of arbitrary elements as contents.  A query
is performed by creating a list structure (using <a href="xmlapi/index.html#create">xml_create</a>),
possibly setting some attributes to restrict the search, and passing it to the appropriate wftk
function.  The library will perform your query (for example, for the tasks active in a given process)
and will add elements to the list which represent the result set.
<p>

The list structure is thus very much like a RecordSet in the Microsoft world.
<p>

To read the contents of a list structure, iterate along it using <a href="xmlapi/index.html#iter">xml_firstelem
and xml_nextelem</a>.

<h3>Example</h3>
A typical list is a list of tasks returned by <a href="task.html#wftk_task_list">wftk_task_list</a>.  It
might look like this (except that I've indented it conveniently, which the wftk won't do):
<pre>
&lt;list process="proc104"&gt;
  &lt;task id="4" user="bob" label="Process application" role="Tech Support"/&gt;
  &lt;task id="6" user="sue" label="Check consistency" role="Purchasing"/&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;
</pre>

Simple.
