<i>(September 24, 2001)</i>: This is the final bit that I implemented quickly in Perl and which I've needed for a while in C.  It's
probably not the last thing I'll ever add to the API, but it's close.
<p></p>
A search is simple: you supply a tree to search, an (optional) element name, and an (optional) attribute and value.  The value is a
format if the searchf variant is used.  Standard C stuff, really.  If you don't give an element name, any element matches; otherwise,
only that element is searched for.  If you give an attribute name, only elements with that attribute will match; if you don't supply
a value, then any nonzero value will match.
<p></p>
If you don't supply element or attribute, you have a way to visit every node in the tree in depth-first order.
<p></p>
The search can continue at the point you left off, if you use search_next or searchf_next and supply the last result as the point to
start.  See search_all for an example of how that can work.
<p></p>
My first attempt at search and search_next used them in mutual recursion, but I soon realized that that approach would grow the stack
to be as large as the entire XML tree.  Not very scalable...  So I switched to iteration and basically duplicated the code in both.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XMLAPI XML * xml_search (XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * value)
{
   int found = 0;
   XML * cur = start;
   XML * next = NULL;

   if (!xml_is_element (start)) return NULL;

   while (!found) {
      found = 1;
      if (element) {
         if (!xml_is (cur, element)) found = 0;
      }
      if (found &amp;&amp; attr) {
         if (value) {
            if (strcmp (value, xml_attrval (cur, attr))) found = 0;
         }
         else if (!*xml_attrval (cur, attr)) found = 0;
      }

      if (found) return cur;

      next = xml_firstelem (cur); /* TODO: Make this an xml_nextdepthfirst. */
      while (!next) {
         if (!next) next = xml_nextelem (cur);
         if (!next) {
            /*if (cur == start || !cur) return NULL;*/
            cur = xml_parent (cur);
            if (cur == start || !cur) return NULL;
         }
      }

      cur = next;
   }
}
XMLAPI XML * xml_searchf (XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * format, ...);
XMLAPI XML * xml_search_next (XML * top, XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * value)
{
   int found = 0;
   XML * cur = start;
   XML * next;

   if (!xml_is_element (start)) return NULL;

   while (!found) {
      next = xml_firstelem (cur);
      while (!next) {
         if (!next) next = xml_nextelem (cur);
         if (!next) {
            if (cur == top || !cur) return NULL;
            cur = xml_parent (cur);
         }
      }

      cur = next;

      found = 1;
      if (element) {
         if (!xml_is (cur, element)) found = 0;
      }
      if (found &amp;&amp; attr) {
         if (value) {
            if (strcmp (value, xml_attrval (cur, attr))) found = 0;
         }
         else if (!*xml_attrval (cur, attr)) found = 0;
      }

      if (found) return cur;
   }
}
XMLAPI XML * xml_searchf_next (XML * top, XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * format, ...);
</pre></td></tr></table>

Of course, I don't actually need the searchf variant yet.  So I'll implement it later...  I hope.

<p></p>
<i>Sep 9, 2003</i> And of course, as usual, I do something else first.  In this case, "search_all" is so convenient I thought
I could really use it for the xml_assemble thingy I'm writing.  So I added it to the XMLAPI.  What it does is create a list
like this:
<pre>
&lt;s&gt;
&lt;loc loc="source.child.child(2)"/&gt;
&lt;loc loc="source.child.child(4)"/&gt;
&lt;loc loc="source.something.else"/&gt;
&lt;/s&gt;
</pre>
In other words, it does the search/search_next thing for you and you can use plain iteration to step through the results.
<p></p>
<i>Sep 19, 2003</i> Finally got to try it out: it works a lot better if you append the hits to the result structure.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XMLAPI XML * xml_search_all (XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * value)
{
   XML * result = xml_create ("s");
   XML * hit;
   int count = 0;
   XML * cur;

   cur = xml_search (start, element, attr, value);
   while (cur) {
      hit = xml_create ("loc");
      xml_set_nodup (hit, "loc", xml_getlocbuf (cur));
      xml_append (result, hit);
      count++;

      cur = xml_search_next (start, cur, element, attr, value);
   }

   xml_setnum (result, "count", count);
   return result;
}
XMLAPI XML * xml_searchf_all (XML * start, const char * element, const char * attr, const char * format, ...);
</pre></td></tr></table>

And I <i>still</i> don't really need the f variant.
