<h2>wftk: Working with Zope</h2>
[ <a href="../index.html">wftk documentation home</a> ]
<hr>

The <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> integration, like most front-end integrations, consists
essentially of three parts.  First, there is the basic exposure of wftk functionality to the Zope
environment.  This part's easy, because it's just the <a href="../python/index.html">Python wrapper</a>.
Second, there is the Zope machinery which integrates that functionality prettily with Zope; this is
not much more than a moderately complex Zope product, and it has yet to be implemented.  The third
part exposes <i>Zope</i> functionality to the <i>wftk</i>, and is likewise unimplemented -- in fact,
I'm not entirely sure what will be required, when it comes down to it.  I know several things will
be necessary, however.  First, we'll want the ability to define repository manager lists on the ZODB.
This will allow any object in Zope to be accessed by wftk, and thus controlled by wftk.  This will be
a list adaptor.  Second, there must be ways to call Zope functions from within workflow procdefs, and
this will be a combination of an action adaptor and a query adaptor.  As these details firm up, this
will be the place to find out more.

<p>

Currently, I have a possible sponsor for the Zope integration work.  That means that Zope integration
is taking a much higher priority than it has to date.
