The wftk::Repository module fronts for repository implementations.  To do this, it
figures out from its instantiation routine which implementation is actually being
requested, then it imports the correct module.  Note: I sure hope this will work.

=head1 NAME

Workflow::wftk::Repository - The Perl front for a workflow repository.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Workflow::wftk::Repository;

Each repository is in reality implemented by a submodule; the
default implementation is "Local", which wraps the wftk C code and
runs in a local directory (although data may, of course, be stored
anywhere -- the local directory merely contains the definitions
used by the repository.)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This will probably usually be called as

  use Workflow::wftk;

  $repos = wftk->Repository();  # Creates a default local repository
                                    # with definitions in the cwd.
  $repos = wftk->Repository('/other/dir');
                                    # Creates a local repository in another
                                    # directory.
  $repos = wftk->Repository(SOAP->'server.name.com');
                                    # Creates a repository which forwards
                                    # all requests to a remote SOAP server.
