<i>December 26, 2003</i>:
Well, here we are, starting out on a new chapter of wftk history.  I seem to have reached the breaking
point with really wanting to write Perl scripts (my hack-until-it-works weapon of choice) against wftk
repositories.  And so I have built an actual CPAN module, and here we go.
<p></p>
<u>What's where</u><br>
The basic structure of this module is a lot like our other OO efforts of the past year; we have
a main module "wftk", which has a "Repository" submodule, and thence "Local" and "SOAP" subsubmodules.
Each subsub implements a variant of the repository on whatever platform works.  I anticipate other
implementations at some point, but (as always) not yet.
<p></p>
use Workflow::wftk 
<ul>
<li><a href="xmlapi.html">use Workflow::wftk::XML</a> - a native Perl port of the <a href="../xmlapi/index.html">XMLAPI</a> library used for all wftk data structures
<li><a href="repository.html">use Workflow::wftk::Repository</a> - the Perl version of the OO schema for the <a href="../repmgr/index.html">repository manager</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="local_repos.html">local repository implementation</a> - the only point of impact on the C-language repmgr implementation, this uses Inline::C to wrap the repmgr library.
<li><a href="soap_repos.html">SOAP repository implementation</a> - this hypothetical implementation talks to a remote SOAP server to implement repmgr functionality.
</ul>

<li><a href="testing.html">Test scripts for the module</a> - all trustworthy CPAN modules rely on Test::Harness to run some basic tests to ensure proper installation.  This one should be no exception.
</ul>

<u>Building a CPAN module</u><br>
I put off implementing this Perl wrapper for a long time, just because I was worried about the learning curve.  As it turned out, it
really wasn't anything to be overly fearful of.  The basics of the module are automagically built for you by running h2xs, and then
I simply took that and reverse-engineered some of it so that my litprog engine wrote source files into the right places, and
everybody turned out happy.

<p></p>
(TODO: narrate a little more, so as not to forget why everything is where it is (possibly already too late...)).

<p></p>
<u>Cutting to the chase: the wftk package</u><br>
This page defines the central wftk package of the module, which really doesn't do a whole lot -- meaning it's an
excellent way to introduce the mechanics of the package itself, before we get into heavier lifting in our
subs and subsubs.  First off, let's bow to the standards and realize that a package definition <i>includes
documentation</i>.  That's pretty darned cool.  But from a writing standpoint, we probably want the documentation
up front, so we define what we're writing, then below that, we implement it.  Isn't it handy, therefore, that
we are doing literate programming?  (Yes, I get confused between levels, too.  But it's all good clean fun in the end.)

<p></p>
Boilerplate first:

Next comes the setup and code of the module itself, which we'll define below:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre><i>See <a href="index.html#code">Actual code</a></i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

And now we're free to write our POD documentation right up front here, defining what the
package is and how it will be used.  The final HTML formatting of this will eventually end up in
the documentation section.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>=head1 NAME

wftk - Perl wrapper(s) for everything to do with the wftk
open-source workflow toolkit.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Workflow::wftk;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The wrapper does nearly all of its work in wftk::Repository.

=head1 AUTHOR

Michael Roberts, wftk@vivtek.com

Well, that could be more informative, but you get the idea.  Now we're free to define our actual code.

<br><br>
<a name="code">
<i>Actual code</i><br>
We start with some standard Perl module/package boilerplate.  It's generated automagically by h2xs when you first
create your module; I tossed out some stuff we won't be using (like Export) but essentially what you see
is what I got.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>package Workflow::wftk;

require 5.6.0;
use strict;
use warnings;

our @ISA = qw();

our $VERSION = '0.01';
</pre></td></tr></table>

Next, we define ... whatever we want, actually.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>sub test {
   print "Whaddaya know...\n";
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

Finally, a last bit of package boilerplate: we return "1" so "use" won't freak, and we "__END__" to allow
the POD documentation stuff to be inserted (remember we already wrote it above.)
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>1;
__END__
</pre></td></tr></table>

And that was a Perl module (and package, at the same time.)  Not so bad.
