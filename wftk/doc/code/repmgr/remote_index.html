The <a href="library.html">repository manager library</a> manages software systems from the point of
view of data management.  It's very versatile and provides a lot of alternative solutions to common problems,
but it can be pretty heavyweight.  Once I got serious about writing an <a href="../mail-handler/index.html">incoming
email handler</a>, I realized that this was a classical application of a client-server architecture, with the
heavy code and state in a server process which was accessed by many small, lightweight clients, one per incoming
message.  There's naturally the added benefit that the two processes can thus also be on separate machines, you
can do load-balancing, whatever.  Lots of flexibility.
<p></p>
So I decided as a part of that to split out the remote-server access code already present in the repository manager
into this repmgr_remote thingy.  Naturally, I wanted to reuse it in the repmgr library as well, but I also wanted
to create a situation in which I could use the self-same API for the remote library, so that client apps could be
written to run against either a remote repository or a local one (the latter being heavier, but it's still a valid
option.)  The resulting strategy was a tricky one, using the C preprocessor to put a namespace identifier onto the
start of each function name.  This lets us compile the same C code twice, once with a prefix on each function name.
I kinda like it.
