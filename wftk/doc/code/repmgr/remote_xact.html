<i>(January 26, 2003)</i>: The repository manager transaction mechanism is probably going to be one of those things I realize I screwed
up on first implementation and work for years to fix.  A transaction groups a set of object changes together which may span any arbitrary
set of lists.  This chunk of changes may be submitted for approval all at once.  While a transaction is being built, it may also be
used as a filter for the repository, so that data retrievals appear to contain the data as changed in the transaction.  Thus a transaction
can be seen as a sandbox for the user.

<p></p>
Where I start to worry is when I start to think about really large-scale transactions.  The initial implementation I'm working on is
unlikely to scale well.  So some kind of transaction-content index scheme needs to be incorporated into the whole thing.
