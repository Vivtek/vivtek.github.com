The API has turned out, of course, to fall into a series of natural sections.  I've mostly kept those more-or-less natural sections
on separate pages in the documentation, but all in all it just goes to show me how much more work I have to put into these documentation
systems.  Anyway, links to the various sections can be found below.

<p></p>
Before we define functions, we have to include a bunch of stuff.  Let's do that.

<a href="repositories.html">Working with repository objects</a>.
<p></p>
All right.  First up is just working with repository objects.  We don't do a lot with them yet beyond opening and closing.  Once the
API has been extended to <i>write</i> repository definition files, this will probably still not be in this section, but rather in the
individual data section (because we'll be treating the repository object just like any other object, of course.)

<p></p>
<a href="publishing.html">Publishing objects: internals</a>.
<p></p>
Next up is the publishing machinery.  This was the original point of departure for the repository manager when I started re-implementing
its Perl-language predecessor OPM.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>

</pre></td></tr></table>

<p></p>
<a href="lists.html">Creating and administering lists</a>.
<p></p>
Working with lists as entities sets the stage for working with list entries.  A lot of this section remains unimplemented, as my
immediate needs are simply to work with entries, not lists.  However, eventually this section will take care of the creation and
destruction of lists within a repository, and allow the user to redefine lists as well.  This will ultimately even allow bulk loading
of SQL tables and things like that, all without any need for the user to care where things are located or how things are moved around.
The repository manager has the potential to be "Access done right."
<p></p>
This section includes list creation routines (unimplemented as of 2003-06-25) as well as metadata query routines and formatting routines.
For metadata, we have repos_defn (which retrieves the definition of a list) and repos_list_choices (which returns a list of valid values for
a field given an object and which list it belongs to).  The repos_define function, unimplemented, will provide a way to change the definition
of a list.
<p></p>
<i>June 29, 2003</i>: for historical reasons which I don't really understand, I also put object-formatting routines in this list.  I guess
there's reason for this: display and formatting are metadata-intensive operations.  Whatever.  Anyway, there are five different routines here:
<ul>
<li>repos_form: given a list ID and a key, gives you an edit form (or a display chunk) depending on the mode you give.  Modes are things like
new, edit, view, and ideally are looked up in the repository definition (although I haven't actually implemented this.
<li>repos_form_direct: given a list description and a key, does the same.
<li>repos_form_object: given a list ID and an object (thus possibly an object which isn't stored, but which has just been constructed) formats the object.
<li>repos_form_object_direct: gets everything explicitly except the mode
<li>repos_format_object: gets just an explicit format, and an object, and formats the object.  This allows us to build a view on the fly and format it
without any extra logic getting in the way.
</ul>
<p></p>

<i>2004-02-04</i>:<br>
For more strange historical reasons, I have several different ways of formatting objects which I like to use.  The layout form is an XML-driven
layout and is handy in many instances, but when I really lay out sites or emails I much prefer the template flags I've used in AOLserver
for many years: [&#35;#tag##] is replaced by the named "tag".  I'm arbitrarily deciding that this is the setup I'll use for views retrieved from
the _views list.  The _views list is a lines-based storage, with one line of key followed by any number of lines of format.  The output of such an
expression is just a string, and so it may
be used to express either HTML or text or whatever, you see.  Very convenient, and easy to write and to understand.  Which is why I've used it for
so long.
<p></p>
Anyway, this format will be used in place of XML layout for many purposes, and at some point the XML layout may well just disappear.  We'll see.
I never liked it much.  It has its uses, thought, so .. in a couple of years I'll know, I guess.  There's no reason not to have two good ways
of doing something, though.  This is a toolkit, after all.

<a href="objects.html">Working with individual objects</a>.
<p></p>
As it so happens, data storage and retrieval is turning out to be the most heavily used area of repository management.  This section
simply defines addition, deletion, and modification of entries in lists.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT int   repos_add   (XML * repository, const char * list, XML * object);

</pre></td></tr></table>
<p></p>
<a href="retrieval.html">Data retrieval</a>.
<p></p>
Once data is stored, retrieval is also a convenient thing to be able to do.  Since a given object can be stored in multiple places (it
may even refer to sublists in other places which are retrieved along with the main object), retrieval can be rather complicated.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>

<p></p>
<a href="iteration.html">Iterating across list contents</a>.
<p></p>
Next is querying of lists -- we can query raw lists, or we can specify order and selection criteria.  The order clause has been implemented
in most adaptors already and is a standard SQL order.  Selection criteria are still rather spotty unless you're working with an
RDBMS-hosted list.  Since list queries try to use indices first, an RDBMS-indexed list can also do selection.  It may well be that I'll
end up with the requirement that you can only trust selection if your list is indexed or something.

<p></p>
<a href="users.html">User authentication and group membership</a>.
<p></p>
User authentication is a relatively new thing.  It uses the USER adaptor class, which makes that class the first to be imported from
the wftk core implementation to work in the repmgr framework.  Cool.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_user_auth    (XML * repository, const char * user_id, const char * passwd);

</pre></td></tr></table>

<p></p>
<a href="context.html">Context/user session handling</a>.
<p></p>
Session contexts are a complicated bit of machinery which allow a session to be established and saved in the repository for later
use.  A session can at minimum store named values, and will eventually also include useful things like the last list used, a command
history, and such.  Any currently open transaction will also be attached to the session, allowing very long-lived transactions.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT char * repos_context_save (XML * repository);
WFTK_EXPORT XML  * repos_context_switch (XML * repository, const char * context_id);
WFTK_EXPORT char * repos_context_get  (XML * repository, const char * name);
WFTK_EXPORT void   repos_context_set  (XML * repository, const char * name, const char * value);

</pre></td></tr></table>

<p></p>
<a href="xact.html">Transactions</a>.
<p></p>
Transactions group changes to data into chunks.  These chunks can be submitted as single change entities, allowing them to undergo
authorization and processing all at once.  While a transaction is active, it may be used as a "lens" to view the repository as though
the suggested changes had already been completed.  Powerful stuff.  In theory, anyway -- if I ever have the chance to write it.
<p></p>
As transactions have not yet been implemented, this API will change.  I include it only because I want to get
the indexing out of the way.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT XML  * repos_xact_open  (XML * repository, const char * key);

WFTK_EXPORT char * repos_xact_save  (XML * repository, XML * xact);
WFTK_EXPORT XML  * repos_xact_start (XML * repository, XML * xact); /* Might be char * key? */
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p></p>
<a href="processing.html">Actions, asynchronous process, and stuff like that.</a>.
<p></p>
Actions are a complex area of functionality which I'm really just now (Feb 15, 2004) starting to understand.  The old wftk core
included an action performer call which could either perform an action immediately or queue it for approval; generalizing that
is proving to be pretty fruitful on a conceptual level, but as usual I'm really not entirely sure where the whole thing will
end up.
<p></p>
Anyway, one aspect of action is the asynchronous processing of actions, which effectively means that if we know something's
going to take a while, we can kick it off to be done by a separate process or even machine, and still return immediately to a
waiting user.  The processing action is modelled as a pending transaction, and the processing entity writes some kind of
progress information to it, so we can check up on it.
<p></p>
In a sense, of course, any workflow process is an asynchronous process.  How we would write progress information is a good
question, but it's a natural one.  Probably need to think about this more carefully at some point....
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_do (XML * repository, XML * action);
WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_do_object (XML * repository, XML * action, XML * object);
</pre></td></tr></table>

We also need some way of figuring out what actions are currently afforded by an object.  An object may have potential or passive
tasks that can be performed, any object has mod/del actions, a non-saved object can be added, and objects can have state transitions.
Task objects can be completed.  And any or all of those actions might be forbidden to the current user, and any or all of them might
be inappropriate to the view the user is currently using.  Our API for this corresponds to the API of views.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_list               (XML * repository, const char * list, const char * key, const char * mode);
WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_list_direct        (XML * repository, XML *        list, const char * key, const char * mode);
WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_list_object        (XML * repository, const char * list, XML *     object, const char * mode);
WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_list_object_direct (XML * repository, XML *        list, XML *     object, const char * mode);

Finally, a function to check for timed actions (scheduled events) which need to be completed.

<p></p>
<a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.
<p></p>
Given that the repository manager is indeed part of the workflow toolkit, you'd think that workflow would play a larger part in
its API.  But as it turns out, not only did I go more than a year without integrating the repmgr with the core workflow engine,
workflow doesn't really need all that much API support.
There are three basic workflow API calls, to allow the attachment of workflow (either as an ad-hoc workflow structure, or as a keyword-indexed
procdef from a designated list of procdefs, or, I suppose, both at once) and the simple creation and enumeration of tasks.
Most of the rest of workflow is integrated with state changes and data modification events.
Each of these calls can either work with a list/key combination, or with an object already retrieved.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT void repos_workflow_start (XML * repository, const char * list, const char * key, XML * wf_defn, const char * wf_id);

<a href="notification.html">Notifications</a> are a generalized outgoing email-like thing; notifications can be generated
during workflow or by the system when various event occur.  This is yet another area where a lot more could be done than I've
actually done so far, but it's a start.
<p></p>
The functions in this section take more parameters than most of my API.  I'm really not sure if this is a good thing or whether
I'm overcomplicating things; I've always found the overblown twenty-parameter Windows API calls to be rather humorous and I
hate to see myself succumb to that urge.  But let's see if it all makes sense.
