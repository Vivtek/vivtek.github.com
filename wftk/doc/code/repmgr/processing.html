<i>(January 26, 2003)</i>:  <i>Asynchronous processing</i> is a catchall term for the following kinds of things a complete system
should be able to do (note that support for this kind of thing requires a complete system, not just the repmgr library.)
<ul>
<li>Task timeouts and deadlines
<li>Queue handling
<li>Periodic reports
<li>Deferred processing for publishing
</ul>

In general, the repos_process call can be thought of as supporting any daemon process which should run in a complete system and do
work that should be done in the background while a user isn't waiting on the result.  The particular motivator for this feature is
task timeouts, which allow limits to be placed on the time that objects may spend in particular states and will trigger automatic
state transitions if those time limits are exceeded.  There is plenty of special logic for that one application built into this
section.

<p></p>

<i>(February 15, 2004)</i>: So obviously I've done nothing with this for over a year, but it's still a good place to dump the rest
of the stuff needed for actions, which I think will subsume the above functionality.  A queued action (or transaction) can have a
timestamp on it; after that time it will fire if polled by a schedule processor.  So the action queue idea covers timeouts pretty
well.  That's cool.  Of course, it means we have to explicitly create queued trigger actions for some things -- or we can understand
trigger classes to cover other applications, in which case repos_process will probably have to do a number of queries to see what
trigger classes might have things waiting to be done.  See?
<p></p>
I can't remember why I thought it was a good idea for this function to return a string instead of an XML object or just ... nothing.
I guess if I ever get around to writing it, I'll either remember why, or change it.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT char * repos_process (XML * repository, const char * list, const char * key)
{
   return NULL;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>


Anyway, let's go ahead with the rest of the action functionality.  First, functions to perform (or queue) actions.  These functions
take an action object, which is an object with complex and developing semantics, like, well, like everything else in the wftk.
The first option simply takes that action object; the other also takes an object to which the action will apply.  I'm not sure which
will end up more useful.
<p></p>
<i>17 Feb 2005</i> - At any rate, each of these functions merely wraps wftk_action (at least for now.)  It probably doesn't even make sense to wrap
wftk_action instead of just calling it directly,  but I have the sneaking suspicion that I will end up considering it a good idea.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_do (XML * repository, XML * action)
{
   wftk_action (repository, action, NULL);
   return (action);
}

WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_do_object (XML * repository, XML * action, XML * object)
{
   wftk_action (repository, action, object);
   return (action);
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

And then a set of functions for determining the actions which are permitted for a user against an object, by name.  This might
be arbitrarily complex to determine (i.e. another application of a rule engine) but in the meantime we'll do something halfway
reasonable.  All these functions return a list of action elements, each with an "id" and a "label".

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_list               (XML * repository, const char * list, const char * key, const char * mode)
{
   return (repos_action_list_direct (repository, repos_defn (repository, list), key, mode));
}
WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_list_direct        (XML * repository, XML *        list, const char * key, const char * mode)
{
   XML * object = repos_get (repository, xml_attrval (list, "id"), key);
   XML * ret    = repos_action_list_object_direct (repository, list, object, mode);
   if (object) xml_free (object);
   return ret;
}
WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_list_object        (XML * repository, const char * list, XML *     object, const char * mode)
{
   return (repos_action_list_object_direct (repository, repos_defn (repository, list), object, mode));
}

WFTK_EXPORT XML * repos_action_list_object_direct (XML * repository, XML *        list, XML *     object, const char * mode)
{
   XML * actions = xml_create ("list");
   XML * action;
   XML * states;
   XML * mark;

   if (!list) return (actions);

   if (!object || !strcmp (mode, "new")) { 
      action = xml_create ("action");
      xml_set (action, "id", "add");
      xml_setf (action, "label", "Add new %s", xml_attrval (list, "id")); /* TODO: label should be configurable. */
      xml_append (actions, action);
   } else {
      /* Standard actions against object. */
      action = xml_create ("action");
      xml_set (action, "id", "mod");
      xml_set (action, "label", "Update");
      xml_append (actions, action);  /* TODO: check actual permissions, view, etc. */
      action = xml_create ("action");
      xml_set (action, "id", "del");
      xml_set (action, "label", "Delete");
      xml_append (actions, action);

      /* State transitions also count as actions, of course.  We modify the name a little to avoid collisions (with a "state-" prefix). */
      states = repos_list_choices (repository, xml_attrval (list, "id"), object, "_state");
      for (mark = xml_firstelem (states); mark; mark = xml_nextelem (mark)) {
         if (!*xml_attrval (mark, "selected")) {
            action = xml_create ("action");
            xml_set (action, "id", "state-");
            xml_attrcat (action, "id", xml_attrval (mark, "value"));
            xml_set_nodup (action, "label", xml_stringcontenthtml (mark));
            xml_append (actions, action);
         }
      }
      if (states) xml_free (states);

      /* Completion of active, passive, and potential tasks are also all actions.  TODO: deal with these. */

      /* If the object itself is a task, completion might be added here if list_choices didn't already list it.  TODO: figure that out. */
   }

   /* TODO: pass the whole list in for rule processing to determine permissibility.  God knows what that will take. */

   return (actions);
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
