The repository manager began its life as a redesign and port of code I'd been working on for a couple of years in
Perl, called "OPM" -- Online Publication Manager.  The point of OPM was to manage websites in
a data-driven manner, pretty much what we all call "content management" nowadays,
but it was difficult to work with and difficult to modify, and at some point it just ground to a halt
due to sheer maintenance overhead.
<p></p>
Since I've pulled that groundwork into the wftk project, I hope for synergy on both ends: on the one hand, the
adaptor architecture should make the repository manager easy to extend, and on the other, the repmgr
also embodies and encapsulates a lot of the motivation for workflow in the first place, providing a
nice framework for content management.
<p></p>
The executable itself is a command-line affair; once I have the time to mess with it, I'll extend it
to include CGI execution, and of course once I get the server daemon framework running we can start
to think about a repository manager service which would listen on specialty and FTP ports, maybe.
Or something.  I guess that will all be obvious once we get that far.
<p></p>
At any rate, unlike the popup framework, the repository manager is written in nice, safe ANSI C.  Like
most of the wftk, it is organized into two sections: the bulk of the work is in a library, and there
is a command-line wrapper around that library.  The library can thus be dropped into any application.
The command-line wrapper assumes that the repository definition will be found in site.opm in the
current directory (the .opm extension is, of course, a holdover from OPM and allows association under
Windows for a GUI front-end, forthcoming if I ever finish it), but the library doesn't really care
where you found your repository definition.
<p></p>
The repository manager can be thought of as<ul>
<li> A front-end for data management (manages RDBMS and local data on an equal footing)
<li> A content management system (organizes websites and allows their structured design)
<li> A document management system (maintains versioned binary files and metadata)
</ul>
<p></p>
As such, it's squarely positioned to do a lot of the back-office tasks required by a medium-sized
business organizational unit.  Along with wftk for workflow and task management, plus some GUI
framework to present the whole thing in a manageable way, we're on our way to a solid set of
enterprise software.

<p></p>
A repository is essentially a directory which contains arbitrary objects and lists of objects.
Objects have fields, sublists, and attachments; lists are loose organizations of objects which may
or may not impose constraints on their structure.  Lists may be stored in many different ways, so a
repository has the capability of managing data in relational databases, local files, or anything in
between, assuming that suitable adaptors have been written and configured.
<p></p>

Besides these datasources, a repository also manages data sinks.  Data sinks may be HTML pages, they
may be email addresses for notification of events, they may be remote connections -- whatever.  And
the final element of a repository definition is all the links between data sources and data sinks, 
which I call <i>publishers</i> from the original OPM code.  A publisher is invoked when a datasource
registers a change, and updates whatever target data it is responsible for (or sends an email, or
starts a workflow process, or whatever.)

<p></p>
A publisher uses a <i>tool</i> to effect these data changes; tool definition is still a pretty vague
area, so at this point, it's hardwired.  Basically, there are two tools at the moment: template
application, which takes structured data and weaves HTML-like text from it, and a Wiki tool, which
takes text with a simple-to-edit markup and weaves fairly well-formatted HTML from that.  My Wiki tool
is very repository-aware, even to the point where it is able to maintain a todo list for problems it
encounters during formatting, use a "link" data source to manage external links, and so on.
