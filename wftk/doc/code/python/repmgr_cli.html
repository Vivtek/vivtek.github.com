The <a href="wxpywf.html">wxPyWf GUI framework</a> I'm building for wxPython workflow apps involves
concentrating bits of functionality into command handlers, so that menus (and presumably other GUI
events) generate commands, which are then handled by the appropriate registered objects.  I've always
liked this pattern, which was used by Microsoft Word 6.0 (at least) when I did a <i>whole</i> lot of
work in the macro language at the time, which later evolved into the whole Visual Basic for Applications
paradigm.
<p></p>
Say what you will about Microsoft's predatory marketing (and I'll agree with you) but I
do really like some aspects of their design philosophy when it comes to making applications programming
make more sense.  The command-based paradigm gives us some really nice spinoffs, such as being able
to compartmentalize functionality in a handy way, being able to build macros without the overhead of
a scripting language (yeah, OK, so I'm writing this in Python, <i>still</i>), and being able to log
actions in a coherent manner.  It's just a nice paradigm.
<p></p>
As proof of this, I plan to use the <i>same</i> command handler in both the <a href="pypop.html">GUI
frontend</a> and the <a href="repmgr_server.html">Medusa-based repmgr server</a>.  That's unification
for ya!  Once both client and server are more or less on a workable basis, I think the whole wftk
effort is going to start to pay off.
<p></p>
So anyway, this implementation of a command handler for the Python repository classes (and by extension
the rest of the wftk classes, I'm sure) serves as a pilot for the whole paradigm.  Basically,
a "CLI object" is any object with a "do" method.  This method takes a list of strings, which is the
command and its arguments, an optional context object (of rather vague provenance at the moment),
and is governed by a mode flag to determine whether it should return a long text response or a
data response or neither.  For instance, the repmgr "list" command can return a short acknowledgement
("50 entries"), a long one (text containing the keys of those entries, which is what the C command-line
utility returns), or a data response (an XML list containing data descriptive of the entries).  The mode
flag is set using a "mode" method.
<p></p>
I'd like to come up with some coherent way for the command language to refer to contextual or
session-based information.  That will probably need to come later after I've banged on an initial
implementation for a while.

The initialization of a CLI object, among other things, has to supply the context object the CLI is
supposed to be fronting for.  In this case, of course, it's a wftk repository object.

<p></p>
Each CLI also has a dictionary of command objects.  At first I was going to gloss over
this aspect, but then I went away for a few weeks, and coming back to this, it's
patently obvious that I need to do things right the first time.  Thus the __init__
function initializes our command dictionary.

So OK, let's get down to the boring business of processing commands.  Each of these commands is nothing more than a thin wrapper
around the Python repmgr wrapper, which in turn wraps the basic repmgr libraries.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   def publish(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def make(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def add(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def del_(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def mod(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def merge(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def changed(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def diff(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def test(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def list(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def changes(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def get(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def edit(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def display(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def form(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def defn(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def define(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def push(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def push_all(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def pull(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def pull_all(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def synch(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def submit(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def store(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def attach(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def retrieve(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def checkout(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def getver(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
   def time(self, context, action, obj):
      return 0;
</pre></td></tr></table>

And that's that.  Our first CLI.
