<i>August 26, 2003</i>:
While building the <a href="../wftk/wftk/action/ACTION_soap.html">SOAP adaptor</a>, I first built a very simple
SOAP test server using Python, because it turned out that SOAP using SOAP.py is <i>really, really easy</i>.
Basically, it's so easy there's no excuse at all not to implement it -- all you have to do is define some 
functions, register them with the SOAP server, then tell the SOAP server to serve.  And you're done.  You can
export any Python function at all this way.  It really is exactly that easy.
<p></p>
Anyway, so there I was, having written the SOAP adaptor, and then Dominik asked me, "So this is a SOAP server, right?"
No, actually it was just a SOAP client so that workflow procdefs could specify the retrieval of arbitrary information
from Web services.  "But wouldn't it be nice if, instead of writing the whole Java JNI wrapper, we could call wftk
from Java using a SOAP service?"  Um, yes.  Yes, it would.  But that wasn't actually what I'd done.  "But this little Python
thing could just as well be exporting wftk functions, right?"  Well, yes.  It could.
And so I dove into the <a href="../java/simple_soap.html">Java simple SOAP client</a>
(which does as little as humanly possible in order to conduct a valid SOAP conversation) and
started the whole Java approach with an abstract Repository class and RemoteSOAPRepository and LocalJNIRepository
and the circles and arrows in four-part harmony and he stopped me right there and said, "Kid, go sit down over
there on the Group W bench."  And so here I am, writing a Python SOAP server and getting all Arlo Guthrie on your
kiester.  This whole month has been quite an experience.  How about some boilerplate?

The SOAP server isn't even object-oriented, it's so simple-minded.  It just consists of a few well-chosen
functions which can be called from Java (and if that's not neat, I frankly don't know what is.)
Heck, at this point I don't even have anything more to say.  Let's code.  The first thing we need to do
is to import the SOAPpy library and the wftk.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>import sys
import SOAPpy
from xmlapi import *
import repmgr
import re
</pre></td></tr></table>

That done, we start up with the local repository.  This is assumed to be an XML file in the local directory;
if none is given, we use "system.defn", which is much better than the old and faintly quaint "site.opm".

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>if len(sys.argv) > 1:
   repos = sys.argv[1]
else:
   repos = 'system.defn'

try:
   repository = xml_read (repos)
except:
   print "Unable to read system definition file '%s'." % repos
   sys.exit (1)

repmgr.open (repository, "SOAP server")

</pre></td></tr></table>

Once the repository is open (and maybe I want to say TODO: some error handling there) then we're on our way
to doing some SOAP!  Let's define what we can do.  You know, I'm starting to think this should also be
based on the CLI interface, but I just don't want to mess with it right now.

<p></p>
Anyway, get and list are both really simple, because they just take key-like information and return stuff.
Note that at least for get I'm distinguishing retrieval modes; the simplest is the map, which returns the
fields and their values with no regard for the complexity of the wftk record.  (I.e. no multiple values for
fields, versions, attachments, or such.)  "Full" mode just returns the XML of the entry as a string.  There's
probably going to be more options at some point.  This kind of thing is obvious once you realize that what you
really need hasn't been implemented yet.

<p></p>
<i>October 15, 2003</i>: Added a "tasks" mode for retrieving the tasks attached to an object.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>def get (list_id, key, mode='map', auth=None, task_key=None):
   if mode == 'new':
      key = None
   if mode == 'edit' or mode == 'new' or mode == 'display':
      return xml_stringcontent (repmgr.form (repository, list_id, key, mode))

   if task_key==None:
      defn = repmgr.defn (repository, list_id)
      rec = repmgr.get (repository, list_id, key)
   else:
      defn = repmgr.defn (repository, "_tasks")
      rec = repmgr.task_get (repository, list_id, key, task_key)

   if mode == 'full':
      return xml_string(rec)

   if mode == 'tasks':
      ret = []
      tasklist = xml_create ("list");
      xml_set (tasklist, "id", "_tasks");
      repmgr.tasks_direct (repository, rec, tasklist);
      for t in xml_elements(tasklist):
         rec = {}
         rec['key'] = xml_attrval (t, 'id')
         rec['id'] = xml_attrval (t, 'id')
         rec['label'] = xml_attrval (t, 'label')
         rec['user'] = xml_attrval (t, 'user')
         rec['role'] = xml_attrval (t, 'role')
         ret.append (rec)

      return ret

   # Default = 'map'
   ret = {}
   for f in xml_elements(rec):
      if xml_is(f, 'field'):
         ret[xml_attrval (f, 'id')] = xmlobj_get (rec, defn, xml_attrval (f, 'id'))
   if task_key != None:
      ret['key'] = xml_attrval (rec, 'key')
   return ret

def list (list_id, mode='keys', auth=None):
   keys = repmgr.list (repository, list_id)
   #if mode == 
   return keys
</pre></td></tr></table>

For add, mod, and merge, we run into a new problem: how does the caller give us our data?  Again assuming a simple
mapping model (field ids and values) for entries, I can think of two ways: the fields can be passed as separate
parameters, or the fields can be passed as a single quoted string of some kind.  The third option might be something
like including the entire XML of the record, either as a parameter value or as an attachment.  (I base that on having
seen the phrase "SOAP with attachments" somewhere, but I don't know if SOAP.py already supports same.)

<p></p>
For consistency's sake, then, I'll implement all of them.  If a parameter starts with "fld_" we'll treat it as a field value;
if a "fields" parameter is included, we'll parse it for quoted values, and if "fields_xml" is given, we'll take it to be
the XML representation of the entry.  We'll run through those in the reverse order I just gave them, so that we can end up with
some kind of amalgamated set of values.  How cool is <i>that</i>?  Anyway, here's a helper function to deal with this:

<p></p>
Thanks to Dominik Kreutz at startext GmbH, build_obj no longer mangles UTF-8-encoded fields.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>def build_obj (fields, fields_xml, loose_fields):
   if fields_xml == None:
      obj = xml_create ("record")
   else:
      obj = xml_parse (fields_xml.decode("utf8"))

   # TODO: Handle "fields"

   for k in loose_fields.keys():
      if re.match ("^fld_", k):
         name = k[4:]
         xmlobj_set (obj, None, name, (loose_fields[k]).encode("latin"))

   return obj
</pre></td></tr></table>

The functions which use it are add, mod, and merge.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>def add (list_id, fields=None, fields_xml=None, auth=None, **loose_fields):
   obj = build_obj (fields, fields_xml, loose_fields)
   repmgr.add (repository, list_id, obj)
   return repmgr.getkey (repository, list_id, obj)

def mod (list_id, key, fields=None, fields_xml=None, auth=None, **loose_fields):
   obj = build_obj (fields, fields_xml, loose_fields)
   repmgr.merge (repository, list_id, obj, key)
   return repmgr.getkey (repository, list_id, obj)

def merge (list_id, key, fields=None, fields_xml=None, auth=None, **loose_fields):
   obj = build_obj (fields, fields_xml, loose_fields)
   repmgr.merge (repository, list_id, obj, key)
   return repmgr.getkey (repository, list_id, obj)
</pre></td></tr></table>

From a technical standpoint, of course, deletion is rather dull.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>def delete (list_id, key, auth=None):
   ret = repmgr.delete (repository, list_id, key)
   return ret
</pre></td></tr></table>

And then we come to tasks and todo, each of which returns a list of objects, not just a simple list of keys.  Those objects turn into a list of
mappings on the client end.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>def tasks (auth=None):
   ret = []
   tasklist = xml_create ("list");
   xml_set (tasklist, "id", "_tasks");
   repmgr.list (repository, tasklist);
   for t in xml_elements(tasklist):
      rec = {}
      for f in xml_elements(t):
         if xml_is(f, 'field'):
            rec[xml_attrval (f, 'id')] = xmlobj_get (t, None, xml_attrval (f, 'id'))
      ret.append (rec)

   return ret

def todo (auth=None):
   ret = []
   tasklist = xml_create ("list");
   xml_set (tasklist, "id", "_todo");
   repmgr.list (repository, tasklist);
   for t in xml_elements(tasklist):
      rec = {}
      for f in xml_elements(t):
         if xml_is(f, 'field'):
            rec[xml_attrval (f, 'id')] = xmlobj_get (t, None, xml_attrval (f, 'id'))
      ret.append (rec)

   return ret
</pre></td></tr></table>

<i>September 20, 2003</i>: getting close to useful functionality now.  Next up is authorization.  Authorization necessarily involves a session
construct, because a client authorizes once, then receives an authorization token which can be passed back to the server on subsequent calls.  This
authorization token will reference a session object (which isn't fully supported by repmgr yet, which is why this is just a first run at authorization.)
The prototype of authorization will simply pass the userid back as a token; this allows us to skip the hard work on the server end and concentrate
on getting the client to do things right.  Moreover, startext's current needs don't include secure authorization, as that will be done at the front-end
level.
<p></p>
So here's the initial auth function.  Note that <i>currently</i> it is using a plaintext userid and password.  This is clearly another point to be marked
as TODO: do some security stuff.  For instance, an MD5 hash of userid and password could be implemented, which would involve the client
first asking for a key,
then sending a hash in a subsequent call to auth.  These requests would use the "mode" argument to distinguish what they were doing, and the authorization
mode could be noted in the session object in order to moderate levels of trust, or length of session validity.
<p></p>
Note that I've included space for an auth token in the auth call itself.  I can imagine this being used to request specific permissions, for instance,
or to implement some kind of negotiation requiring a context.  Dunno yet, but it doesn't hurt anything to put it there.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>def auth(userid, password, mode='clear', auth=None):
   return userid
</pre></td></tr></table>

So that was the functionality we're exposing.  Once your functions are defined,
you can register them, and tell the server to serve, and presto!  A SOAP server!


<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>#TODO: override server definitions on command line
server_url = xmlobj_getconf (repository, "config.soap.server", "localhost")
server_port = int(xmlobj_getconf (repository, "config.soap.port", "8000"))
SOAPpy.Config.debug=int(xmlobj_getconf (repository, "config.soap.debug", "0"))  # Set to '1' to see everything that happens, and I mean everything.


server = SOAPpy.SOAPServer((server_url, server_port))
server.registerFunction(get)
server.registerFunction(list)
server.registerFunction(add)
server.registerFunction(mod)
server.registerFunction(merge)
server.registerFunction(delete)
server.registerFunction(tasks)
server.registerFunction(todo)
server.registerFunction(auth)

print "Listening on %s:%d for requests against %s" % (server_url, server_port, repos)
if SOAPpy.Config.debug==1: print "Debug mode ON"

server.serve_forever()   # TODO: maybe some error handling here.
</pre></td></tr></table>

That's it.  Welcome to SOAP.  I always thought it would be a lot harder, didn't you?
<p></p>
<i>September 4, 2003</i> -- When distributing Python apps, I always
use the <a href="http://www.mcmillan-inc.com/installer_dnld.html">McMillan Installer</a> to package them up (a brilliant utility, it somehow manages
to precompile all necessary Python, then find all DLL dependencies and magically put them into a single distribution directory for zipping.)
One problem: SOAPpy was being naughty, and attempted to import the Utilities.py module twice.  When interpreting, Python didn't care, but in the
Installer-frozen state, it sure did.  I wrapped the second import in a try-except and lo! it worked.  This killed most of a day.  Just so you know.
