<i>August 18, 2006</i>:
One of the things I've wanted to be able to do for some time is to have a repository running on my machine
to which I could forward mail.  That forwarded mail would go into a queue (or multiple queues) and processing
would then proceed however it was deemed appropriate: a workflow system, if you will.  The element missing
is actually pretty simple; something has to sit there and interpret SMTP conversations.
<p></p>
My first attempt at that was the C-language <a href="../mail-handler/index.html">mail handler code</a>, which
I started and abandoned in 2002.  I just didn't have enough motivation to slog through that in C, it appears.
This attempt, some four years later, takes the easy/lazy route of prototyping in Python; if I need it later
in a more streamlined or more portable form, I will convert then.
<p></p>
I'm implementing this based on the asyncore module; SOAPpy and Zope are also based on asyncore and it's pretty
darned slick.  Even slicker is that Python 2.1 and up include an smtpd module out of the box.  So basing an
SMTP server on asyncore is simply a question of defining the handler.

First, let's import the wftk and asyncore.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>import sys
import asyncore
import smtpd
from xmlapi import *
import repmgr
import re
</pre></td></tr></table>

That done, we start up with the local repository.  This is assumed to be an XML file in the local directory;
if none is given, we use "system.defn", which is much better than the old and faintly quaint "site.opm".

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>if len(sys.argv) > 1:
   repos = sys.argv[1]
else:
   repos = 'system.defn'

try:
   repository = xml_read (repos)
except:
   print "Unable to read system definition file '%s'." % repos
   sys.exit (1)

repmgr.open (repository, "SMTP server")

</pre></td></tr></table>

Once the repository is open (and maybe I want to say TODO: some error handling there) then we're on our way
to listening for mail.  The rule is essentially that all lists in the repository are mail-enabled.  The addressee
of any incoming mail is assumed to be the list name (later we may want to be more sophisticated, but for now
that's what we've got).  The mail message is used to create a new entry for that list.  Workflow can then
be used to do whatever else might be appropriate, but that will be internal to wftk and not something this
module needs to worry about.

<p></p>
What this module <i>does</i> need to worry about is two things:
<ul>
<li>The asyncore-based SMTP listener needs to establish mail conversation sessions
<li>Something in there needs to construct and parse incoming mail messages to be able to do "appropriate things" with them
</ul>

"Appropriate things" include stripping out attachments and treating them as document-management fodder, for instance, or parsing
command structures, perhaps.
<p></p>
The first thing to do is to define our server.  This is essentially the DebuggingServer from the smtpd.py module itself.  It
receives the message, then does the Right Thing with it.  We hope.  It calls some parsing functions defined below, but basically
all you see here is the method override for 'process_message'.  About as simple as we could imagine.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>class wftkSMTPServer(smtpd.SMTPServer):
    # Do something with the gathered message
    def process_message(self, peer, mailfrom, rcpttos, data):
        print "peer: %s; mailfrom: %s; rcpttos: %s" % (peer, mailfrom, rcpttos)
        lines = data.split('\n')
        print '---------- MESSAGE FOLLOWS ----------'
        for line in data.split('\n'): print line
        print '------------ END MESSAGE ------------'


</pre></td></tr></table>


And finally, the code to create the server object and let it run.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>#TODO: override server definitions on command line
server_host = xmlobj_getconf (repository, "config.smtp.host", "localhost")
server_port = int(xmlobj_getconf (repository, "config.smtp.port", "25"))

server = wftkSMTPServer((server_url, server_port), ('127.0.0.1', '80'))

print "Listening on %s:%d for mail to %s" % (server_url, server_port, repos)

asyncore.loop()   # TODO: maybe some error handling here.
</pre></td></tr></table>
