My first stab at a <a href="../popup/index.html">simple popup IM-type UI for wftk</a> was based on wxWindows and kind of
bogged down in the fact that I hadn't really thought the whole data management question through (which led to the
<a href="../repmgr/index.html">repository manager</a> in the first place) and also the fact that C++ is just not something
I use every day, whereas Python is starting to be, thanks to wxPython (which makes GUI work <i>so</i> easy to do!)
<p></p>
So I thought maybe I could jumpstart development of a workable wftk front-end by moving into Python for prototyping;
my goal with the C++ compiled popup UI is that hopefully it'll be possible to cram an entire popup client with configuration
onto a floppy diskette -- that would be very cool.  Python is far too heavy to make that work, but Python is attractive
for other reasons (for instance, you can easily imagine custom Python code being a repository list itself, allowing the
repository to remote-configure and remote-upgrade its clients.  That'd be a powerful feature!)
<p></p>
(Note as of 2006: what the hell is a floppy disk?)  (Sigh...)
<p></p>
But one way or the other, I think having a quick popup UI will help me focus on needed functionality for the wftk system as
a whole, and motivate wider acceptance as well.  I think it'll be a useful addition to the toolkit.

We import the wftk OO wrapper, the wxPyWf library of handy wftk/wx UI tools, the command handler for repositories,
and of course wxPython itself.
This presentation is a pretty reasonable overview of the structure of a wxPython program in general.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>import wftk
import wxpywf
import string
from wxPython.wx import *

</pre></td></tr></table>

The popup framework accepts a definition file for the application to be run, as argv[1].  Let's read it in and parse it (it's XML, of course).
TODO: this should actually probably be treated as the repository definition, and loaded as such.  We can deal with the details later.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>d = open (sys.argv[1])
defn = wftk.xml (d.read())
d.close()
</pre></td></tr></table>



Now we're down to the actual, you know, <i>program</i>.  The core of any wxPython program is at least one class implementing the frame object.
This class provides a central
place to hang all the windows stuff, defines menus and event handlers, and so forth.  The "stock program" consists of a
single such frame class, along with a bunch of handling code, dialog builders/handlers, and so on.

<p></p>
The structure of a wxPyWf program, however, deviates somewhat from the norm.  Instead of providing different handler
functions for each menu entry (which is normal), wxPyWf menus are instead given command-line handlers, which they then
call directly to handle menu events.  That makes the frame class a whole lot simpler under wxPyWf.

<p></p>
For pypop, most of the logic of the program is thus in two places: first, the startup, where we build the menu structure
for the repository being displayed; and second, a small CLI module which handles commands like "open" and "exit".

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>class main_window(wxpywf.frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, id, dialog):
        wxpywf.frame.__init__(self, parent, defn, dialog)

</pre></td></tr></table>

Most of the bulk of the actual framework program is thus likely to be opening and scoping out the repository definition, along with
construction of the menu.

<p></p>
At any rate, we continue by defining and calling an application object:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>class App(wxApp):
    def OnInit(self):
        if defn['mode'] == '': defn['mode'] = 'frame'
        starter = defn.search (defn['mode'], 'id', defn[defn['mode']])
        cli_list = []
        #for c in defn.elements():
        #   if c.is_a('commands') and c['python'] != '':
        #      try:
        #         import c['python']
        #         cli_list = cli_list + [c['python'].cli(None)]
        #      except:
        #         wxpywf.notify_user ("Attempt to load command line definition %s failed." % c['python'])
        if starter:
           frame = main_window(None, defn, starter)
           self.SetTopWindow(frame)
           return true
        else:
           wxpywf.notify_user ("Starting %s '%s' undefined.  Cannot start." % (defn['mode'], defn[defn['mode']]))
           return false

app = App(0)
app.MainLoop()
</pre></td></tr></table>
And that, in a nutshell, is a wxPython program.

<p>
A note on dynamic loading: see http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/223972 -- describes how to
load modules dynamically at runtime based on the configuration file.  Useful schtuff.  But more than I want to handle
right now.  TODO: this.
