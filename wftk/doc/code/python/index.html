<h2>PyWFTK: wftk workflow manipulation in Python</h2>
<hr>
OK, this is the homepage for the subproject PyWFTK, which is a set of Python wrappers, add-ons,
and other convenient tools for the <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/wftk.html">wftk workflow toolkit</a>.
Python is awfully nice to work with, not only because the language itself is relatively simple to
work with, but also because of two unbelievably nice frameworks in the Python world: Medusa for
building simple servers, and wxPython for building cross-platform GUIs.  It is <i>so</i> easy to
work with these things.
<p>
So PyWFTK consists of three categories of thing: wrappers to expose wftk functionality to Python
and vice versa, client tools, and server tools.  In detail, they are:
<ul>
<li>Wrappers
  <ul>
  <li><a href="py_xmlapi.html">Low-level XMLAPI wrapper, in C</a>
  <li>Low-level wftk core wrapper (not written yet)
  <li><a href="py_repmgr.html">Low-level repository wrapper, in C</a>
  <li><a href="wftk_oo.html">Object-oriented high-level wftk wrapper, in Python</a>
  </ul>
<li>Command-line interpreter shared by the client tools and the server
<li>Client tools
  <ul>
  <li><a href="wxpywf.html">wxPyWf, a library for building wxPython GUIs using the XMLAPI and wftk</a>
  <li><a href="pypop.html">PyPop, a simple popup UI for wftk in wxPython</a>
  </ul>
<li><a href="repmgr_server.html">The repmgr server</a> -- a <a href="http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/">Medusa</a>-based
workflow server.  Medusa is just unbelievably slick.
<li><a href="soap_server.html">The SOAP server</a> -- a <a href="http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/">SOAPpy</a>-based
workflow server.  SOAPpy is just unbelievably slick.  In fact, lots of Python stuff is unbelievably slick.
</ul>


All in all, what we have here is a complete wftk smorgasbord.
