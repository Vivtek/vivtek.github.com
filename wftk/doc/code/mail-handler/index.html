<h2>Handling incoming mail</h2>
<hr>
A rather frequent situation in workflow is that incoming mail to a special account should
initiate some action -- a customer submits a problem, and so the workflow system needs to
start a process, assign it a definition, index it, and start a clock ticking.  The mail
handler is the component that interfaces the email system with workflow.  Since in this
situation the mail handler is what invokes workflow action (and not the other way around),
the mail handlers are not adaptors, but UI wrappers, if very simple ones.
<p>
There are two mail handlers, at least initially.  One is the wftk-bare mail handler, which
doesn't involve the repository manager and thus may be more useful for simpler installations.
The other is the repmgr mail handler, which relies on the repository manager library to do
its work.  The wftk-bare manager uses a datasheet repository adaptor (dsrep) to create a datasheet
corresponding to the mail it receives, while the repmgr handler uses a list adaptor to create
a list entry.  Otherwise they work substantially identically.
<p>
They share common code to do the work of parsing the mail.  This code is in the mail_reader
object file.

<ul>
<li><a href="mail_reader.html">mail_reader email/MIME parser</a>
<li><a href="wftk_mail.html">wftk-bare mail handler</a> (coming soon)
<li><a href="repmgr_mail.html">repmgr mail handler</a>
</ul>

Further refinements at a later date might include the ability to recognize an incoming
mail as related to an existing process, and attaching it to that process.  I think it
should be possible, however, to set up a procdef to do that automatically via script
in some way even with the current mail handlers.
<p>
<i>(July 26, 2002)</i>: In wrestling with this code, I have come to realize that the way
I'm dealing with disseminating information about static-linked adaptors frankly sucks.  So my new plan
is to create a library system which includes the core code in one library (-lwftk, -lrepmgr), and
puts the local system's static adaptors into a second library which would be compiled to contain
the adaptors staticly linked on that system.  This second library would be, say, -lwftk_a and would
then contain the function <code>wftk_lookup_static_adaptors</code>; this function would be compiled
uniquely for each installation and would return the usual information about local static adaptors.
