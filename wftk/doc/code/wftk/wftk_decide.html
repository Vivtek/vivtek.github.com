This approach to XML decision trees is the result of a year's thought, more or less.  We'll see how it works.  It's
uniquely appropriate to XML, because the decision process is really a collapsing of an XML element hierarchy.  The
decision takes place in the context of a datasheet, of course, for access to values.
<p></p>
The problem with representing an if-then-else structure in XML, of course, is that it doesn't fit.  The obvious first
way to code an "if" would be:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&lt;if value="3" equal="3"&gt;result&lt;/if&gt;</code><br>
but where do you put an "else"?  You don't want it in the content of the <code>if</code>, because then you can't tell
the difference between actual content and the "else", and it's not elegant to have results of the same test at different
levels of the hierarchy -- sooner or later you'd screw it up.  And where do you put negations?  Where do you put
boolean functions like "and" or "or"?  Into the tests?  Then how many different test attributes will you allow?  It <i>just
doesn't work</i> and it's driven me crazy until now.
<p></p>
So I think I've got it worked out.
<p></p>
Basically, these elements are involved: <code>decide</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>then</code>, <code>else</code>,
<code>any</code>, <code>all</code>, and <code>unless</code>.  The rules work like this: we scan elements of the top-level
decision element.  An "if" is a single test, and if it succeeds, then its attributes are written to the decision element
and its content replaces that of the decision element:
<pre>
&lt;decide&gt;
 &lt;if value="3" equal="3" result="yes"&gt;content here&lt;/if&gt;
&lt;/decide&gt;
</pre>
thus reduces to <code>&lt;decide result="yes"&gt;content here&lt;/decide&gt;</code>, while
<pre>
&lt;decide&gt;
 &lt;if value="3" equal="4" result="yes"&gt;content here&lt;/if&gt;
&lt;decide&gt;
</pre>
just reduces to <code>&lt;decide/&gt;</code>.
<p></p>
It's obvious, then, what <code>else</code> should do.  It's the catchall that succeeds when all <code>if</code>s have
failed:
<pre>
&lt;decide&gt;
 &lt;if value="3" equal="2" result="2"&gt;it was two&lt;/if&gt;
 &lt;if value="3" equal="4" result="4"&gt;it was four&lt;/if&gt;
 &lt;else result="neither"&gt;it wasn't two or four&lt;/else&gt;
&lt;/decide&gt;
</pre>
reduces to <code>&lt;decide result="neither"&gt;it wasn't two or four&lt;/decide&gt;</code>.  See?  So far, so good.  Note that we can have multiple
cases, since XML makes it easy to put them there.  In this, the <code>decide</code> tag is really more like a <code>select</code>
statement or a LISP <code>cond</code> statement.
<p></p>
OK.  I'll gloss over the <code>unless</code> element, which simply is a negated <code>if</code>, and cut to the chase with
combinations: <code>all</code> requires that all of its tests succeed, and <code>any</code> will succeed if any of its
tests succeed.  The tests are again <code>if</code> elements, but in this case, we need a catchall place to put results and
content, so that's where the <code>then</code> element comes into play.  An example might be a good idea:
<pre>
&lt;decide&gt;
  &lt;if value="3" equal="2" result="2"&gt;it was two&lt;/if&gt;
  &lt;any anyfired="yep"&gt;
    &lt;if value="3" equal="4" result="4"/&gt;
    &lt;if value="3" equal="3" result="3"/&gt;
    &lt;then thenresult="then was here"&gt;it was either four or three&lt;/then&gt;
  &lt;/any&gt;
&lt;/decide&gt;
</pre>
will reduce to <code>&lt;decide anyfired="yep" result="3" thenresult="then was here"&gt;it was either four or three&lt;/decide&gt;</code>.  The
<code>all</code> element works in an entirely analogous manner.
<p></p>
Another <code>decide</code> element may replace any <code>then</code> or <code>else</code> for
recursive decisions.  I don't like that much, but at the moment I don't see a better solution for implementing nested
tests, for the same reasons that the if-then-else doesn't work: you can't effectively mix arbitrary content with elements
you want to do something with.

<i>Testing for criteria</i><br>
Actually checking values for equality or whatever is done the same for <code>if</code> and <code>unless</code>,
so I'm going to split it out into a function.  That makes it easier to extend, too.
<p></p>
<i>December 29, 2004</i>: Several years later, I decide to extend it...  Added a "field" attribute to be
interpreted by xmlobj_get if we want to avoid that ${} stuff from wftk_value_interpreta.  Also decided by
decree that the test value is going to be subjected to xmlobj_format instead of wftk_value_interpreta, and
added "lt" and "gt" as tests.  TODO: a better test value interpreter, which would really ideally be something
more like a Tcl eval or something.  Also, glob matching, regexp, stuff like that.  A notion: instead of
just "field" and "value", we could also have a "calc" attribute which would be an entire arithmetic (or string)
evaluation.  I'm not sure about how best to do this (obviously) -- for one thing, you'd really want to have
some kind of function declaration, and for that you need both a namespace and some interpreter -- but without
it, the semantics of the decision structure are pretty sparse.  The same goes for wftk in general, of course,
and I see that I once had high hopes for a <code>wftk_value_calc</code> call to do this sort of thing, so perhaps
sometime in 2005 (!) I will get to implementing that.
