<h2>ACTION adaptor: http</h2>
<hr>
<p></p>
HTTP communications are a rather important set of protocols.  Besides simple Web page retrieval,
HTTP is the major protocol used for SOAP and XML-RPC interaction, and it's the protocol underlying
WebDAV.  Since all these protocols are important for the wftk, the HTTP adaptor, which defines a
general set of HTTP tools as well as a thin layer of calling logic, is probably our first really
significant action adaptor.
<p></p>
Actions in general are, like everything in the wftk system, XML structures.  When an adaptor
receives an action structure, it extracts the information it finds salient, and then possibly
modifies the action in some way.  This is how the <a href="ACTION_soap.html">SOAP adaptor</a>
works: it receives a SOAP action, preprocesses it to explain to the HTTP adaptor what to do,
and then calls the present adaptor.  After this adaptor returns, the SOAP adaptor does additional
work to process the reply and route data according to the action definition it received.
<p></p>
A similar process will apply to a WebDAV adaptor, when I get around to writing one.
<p></p>
Originally it seemed logical to me to provide HTML parsing logic in the HTTP adaptor, but
now I think it makes more sense to write a separate HTML adaptor which would perform parsing
tasks.  The HTTP adaptor is thus cleaner and smaller.
<p></p>
The HTTP adaptor is based solidly on <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">libcurl</a>, which is my
library of choice for dealing with HTTP or FTP matters.  (And thus makes me wonder when I
might do an FTP adaptor as well.)  SSL services are also provided in libcurl (although separately,
thanks to U.S. law.)

The <code>adaptor_info</code> structure is used to pass adaptor info (duh) back to the
config module when it's building an adaptor instance.  Here's what it contains:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>static char *names[] = 
{
   "init",
   "free",
   "info",
   "do"
};

XML * ACTION_http_init (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, va_list args);
XML * ACTION_http_free (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, va_list args);
XML * ACTION_http_info (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, va_list args);
XML * ACTION_http_do (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, va_list args);

static WFTK_API_FUNC vtab[] = 
{
   ACTION_http_init,
   ACTION_http_free,
   ACTION_http_info,
   ACTION_http_do
};

static struct wftk_adaptor_info _ACTION_http_info =
{
   4,
   names,
   vtab
};
</pre></td></tr></table>

Cool.  So here's the incredibly complex function which returns a pointer to that:

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>struct wftk_adaptor_info * ACTION_http_get_info ()
{
   return &amp; _ACTION_http_info;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

Thus concludes the communication with the config module.  Now on with the actual implementation
of functionality.  It's not complicated.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XML * ACTION_http_init (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, va_list args) {
   xml_set (ad->parms, "spec", "wftk");
   return (XML *) 0;
}
XML * ACTION_http_free (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, va_list args) { return (XML *) 0; }
</pre></td></tr></table>

Next up is the info call, which builds and returns a little XML telling the caller about the
adaptor.  If the adaptor itself is NULL, then it just returns info about the installed
adaptor handler; otherwise it's free to elaborate on the adaptor instance.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>XML * ACTION_http_info (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, va_list args) {
   XML * info;

   info = xml_create ("info");
   xml_set (info, "type", "action");
   xml_set (info, "name", "http");
   xml_set (info, "ver", "1.0.0");
   xml_set (info, "compiled", __TIME__ " " __DATE__);
   xml_set (info, "author", "Michael Roberts");
   xml_set (info, "contact", "wftk@vivtek.com");
   xml_set (info, "extra_functions", "0");

   return (info);
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p></p>

Now that the administration has been taken care of, we come to the core of any action adaptor,
the "do" action.  The action specification for the HTTP adaptor is fairly simple (it may become
more interesting later.)
<pre>
&lt;action handler="http" url="http://my.server.com" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;field id="first"&gt;value here&lt;/field&gt;
  &lt;content&gt;specifically generated content here (overrides fields for POST/GET construction)&lt;/content&gt;
  &lt;result field="objfield"/&gt;
  &lt;headers-out&gt;
    &lt;field id="Referer"&gt;my.referrer.here&lt;/field&gt;
  &lt;/headers-out&gt;
  &lt;headers&gt;
    &lt;field id="Cookie"&gt;cookie setting stuff here&lt;/field&gt;
  &lt;/headers&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;
</pre>

A few words of explanation.  The "method" attribute may be anything.  GET is, of course, the default; POST is also
understood by the adaptor; anything else may freely be used, but of course isn't guaranteed to work.  For POST or GET,
the adaptor will use "field" elements to build an appropriately formatted request.  If the "field" element has a "field"
attribute, then it will look to the datasheet for a value; otherwise it is a standard xmlobj field.  If the "content"
element is present, then the adaptor will <i>not</i> use the "field" elements to construct the content to be sent, but
will instead use the pre-built content provided (this is to make things easy for the SOAP adaptor.)
<p></p>
If a "headers-out" record is present, any headers encoded there will be prepended to the request (the same "field" logic
is used to gather information from the associated datasheet.)
<p></p>
If a "result" element is provided, it can specify what the adaptor is to do with the HTTP response; incoming headers will
always be attached to the "headers" record, but the text response will either be taken care of as specified in the "result"
element, or a "result" element will simply be created, and the text response will be written as content to that element;
the caller can then post-process as required.  (An interesting extension would be the specification of a post-processing
adaptor within that "result" element.)
<p></p>
Cookies are not handled by the adaptor at all.  They should be eventually, though, and this would presumably be done using
a record registered to a list as a cookie jar.  This record could then either be saved or discarded as required.
<p></p>
Finally, if an SSL-enabled libcurl is used to compile the adaptor, then HTTPS URLs can be supplied.  Eventually I suppose
FTP URLs could be handled in the same way, although I'm not entirely sure how that should work.  An FTP list adaptor built
on this kind of action adaptor would, however, be very attractive.
<p></p>
To business: libcurl requires a setup and breakdown for the library in order to prevent memory leaks, but for the
time being I'm going to ignore that completely, since there's no convenient place to store this handle.  I could conceivably
store it in the repository, but as there's no guarantee that there will only be one repository opened during the course
of the program, I feel somewhat nervous about doing this.  Eventually I will figure out a better way of saving this (or
modify libcurl in order to handle this in a way more convenient to our situation) but in the meantime, a few memory leaks are
simply not all that horrible, in my eye.  As always, your mileage may differ, and if so, please get in touch and make some
suggestions, if you can think of any.  Formally: TODO: figure out a better way to manage libcurl library stuff.
<p></p>
It makes a lot of sense to be able to specify some libcurl parameters in the repository as configuration (proxy information,
for instance) but as I don't really have a well-developed system configuration mechanism, I'll content myself with another
TODO: repository- or system-level configuration parameters for libcurl.  Happy now?
<p></p>
So.  Ignoring things makes quick work.  All that's left is just setting up a session, making the request, and cleaning up.
