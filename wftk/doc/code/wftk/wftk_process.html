<hr>
The process is one of the two dual central data structures of the workflow engine.  I've explained this here and there
anyway, but this is another good place to take another run at it.  Basically, the <i>process</i> represents something of
which the system is aware, while <i>tasks</i> represent things which have to be done in order to respond to that something.
Tasks may exist without processes, whenever individual people decide they want to keep track of things they have to do
which are effectively external to the workflow system.  Processes may exist without tasks, if nobody has to do anything
about whatever it is that the process represents.  Where I personally think that a number of workflow and workflow-like
systems go wrong is in assuming that one or the other representation is the "really central" viewpoint.
<p></p>
At any rate, the internal representation of a process is what I call a <i>datasheet</i>.  In the simplest of datasheet
repositories, these datasheets are simply stored as XML files in a directory.  More sophisticated repositories can build
the datasheets as needed after querying a database, for instance, but internally all we care about is the XML
representation.  The term "datasheet" arose when I was attacking the problem from the task viewpoint, and realized I needed
a central point of storage for arbitrary data values.  As this central point of storage was obviously also a good place to
store the process state, active tasks, and so forth, the datasheet became the process.
<p></p>
The wftk provides tools for both viewpoints and remains agnostic on points of theory.  The functions in the wftk API
which deal with processes are pretty straightforward.  We need to create them, load and save them, attach procdefs to
them, archive old ones, and delete unneeded ones.  Almost all this functionality is provided by the datasheet repository
adaptor, so these functions are short and sweet.

<p></p>
The functions for creation, load, and save are so straightforward I'll just lump them all together here.  Eh, come to
think of it, deletion is the same, so here it is, too.

<p></p>
<i>13 July 2002</i>: Really, I'm just about done with things I want to do before a v1.0 release.  Really.  This feature is a
default procdef for each datasheet repository.  If there is a default, then we start the default procdef on any new process
created, and store the process.  I personally think that's a more sensible approach for most installations.

Next is <code>wftk_process_define</code>, which attaches a procdef to a process.  The question may very well arise as to
exactly why this is necessary.  The answer may not satisfy some people, but it's simply that wftk supports the notion of
an <i>ad-hoc process</i>, which is essentially a folder in which ad-hoc tasks may be grouped and which may also store arbitrary
values for those grouped tasks.  It has no real workflow functionality at all, so it needs no procdef.  In this mode,
the datasheet really is just a datasheet.  (Note: this non-workflow folder has evolved into the entire repmgr module.)
<p></p>
So for better or worse, we have to call two functions to set up a workflow process instead of one.  That just doesn't
seem like such a sacrifice to me.
<p></p>
The version call returns a little value holder XML, which is simply XML of the form <code>&lt;value value="something"&gt;</code>.  It's
a cheap little dodge.  The current XMLAPI is not good at all with buffer management, but it's still a closer approximation
to a heap than anything in native C, so I'm finding myself using it a lot.  Later I'll do a better job with it and that
will automagically improve the workflow engine.
<p></p>
It's been said that any sufficiently complex program implemented in C contains most of an
implementation of LISP.  (The implication being that you might as well save time and write
LISP to start with.)  I'm starting to believe this.  But I <i>still</i> think this code is
much more readable than the equivalent LISP would be, and I know it's more portable, too.
<p></p>
<i>(May 26, 2002)</i> So here I am, wrapping up the last little (and frankly not <i>so</i> little) changes before
I release the initial production-level version of the wftk core engine into the world.  It's amazing; it's been over
two years since I started down this road, and even now I've barely scratched the surface.  The only reason I'm calling
this bit of work the "initial release" is that I believe that it will be the last change to the structure of the datasheet
XML that I'll need.
<p></p>
The original libary envisioned a single process definition attached to any one datasheet; as it turns out, that's too simplistic.
I had conflated the notions of <i>data class</i> with </i>activity class</i> -- reasonable if I'm calling a datasheet a process,
but as it turns out, not powerful enough to express some rather obvious ideas when coming from the repository manager end of things.
During the course of development of the repository manager (which defines the <i>data class</i> explicitly and much more expressively
than the attached procdef could) it became obvious that certain actions taken against a datasheet (or process) introduce certain
snippets of workflow.  Initially I saw those as ad-hoc workflow, but eventually I twigged to a simple fact: most of those activities
are <i>not</i> ad-hoc; they're defined, and thus should be procdef workflow, managed by the same versioned procdef manager as any.
And so I came upon the obvious: workflow is attached to a datasheet via a <code>workflow</code> element, which may be explicit
(thus ad-hoc workflow) or a reference (and thus defined workflow).  This workflow element thus replaces the earlier practice of
writing the procdef data into the datasheet's top-level attributes, which I frankly hated anyway.
<p></p>
However, practically speaking this is an inconvenient relaxation (from one to arbitrarily many procdefs attached) because it
touches on a lot of places in the code.  The first is of course wftk_process_define -- which now must be more sophisticated.  It
will, on the other hand, resolve a problem I've had with this API: the idea that attachment (define) and queuing (start) of a
procdef are separate.  This has reason -- specifically, if a procdef has data requirements, then those must be met before
it is officially started (i.e. its first tasks are made active).  Thus those data requirements become part of the potential
task "!start" which the core engine reported when asked for an active task.
<p></p>
Now let's imagine that wftk_process_define simply <i>checks</i> data requirements explicitly.  If the data requirements
aren't satisfied by pre-existing data when the procdef is attached, then it's clear that we can explicitly create a start
task which contains those data requirements, and queue this task on the process.  But what happens if the data requirements
<i>are</i> met?  In this case, wftk_process_define creates a start task anyway (which is consistent with earlier behavior)
but a new function "wftk_process_start" does not -- instead it simply queues the procdef silently, and tasks are created.
This will probably become the standard modality, but I suspect that there will be times when we need the original behavior,
which is why I'm keeping it.  Note that the two API functions are naturally mere wrappers around a common flagged implementation.
<p></p>
<i>Jun 12, 2002</i>: OK, OK, still haven't released this v1.0 yet -- just one more thing, really.  State-based procdefs.  They
impact here only in that we want to mark the workflow element so it won't get deleted when it finishes, because state transitions
are ageless.
<p></p>
<i>Jun 25, 2002</i>: Well, one more thing: if there's a state "start" defined, then it gives us our start tasks.  So we shouldn't
create our own.

Here's a function to load the procdef version associated with a workflow element.  It's considerably cleverer than its
predecessor in the old single-procdef regime; it can deal with ad-hoc or defined workflow equally well.  It loads defined
workflow into the binary pointer of the workflow element.  This has the advantage of being completely transparent when
saving the datasheet, but still being freed properly with the datasheet.  I'm really rather happy I was smart enough to
add that binary pointer in the first place.
<p></p>
A subtlety here: we check for firstelem before we check for a binary handle.  This allows me to insert an ad-hoc-ish start
task into a defined workflow; after it fires, we delete it and load the procdef to queue it.  Thus before start, the
defined workflow looks just like an ad-hoc flow with its start task.  After, it works properly as a defined workflow.

Finally, in the API I've defined a function to be used to archive datasheets which are no longer needed.  I haven't
really thought this through, so I'm going to leave it pretty much undefined for the time being, or more specifically,
I'm going to assume that the individual adaptors have something coherent to offer here.  Intuitively I feel that this
is too simplistic, that there should be an archive adaptor or something, so maybe the "archive" parameter will specify
that.  But right now I don't want to deal with it.

<i>(March 31, 2000)</i>  OK, as of now, things are getting funky.  The <code>wftk_process_adhoc</code> function takes
an arbitrary piece of workflow script and attaches it to a process.  This code is stored in the process, not in a procdef,
and it runs right from there.  To make the location stay constant, we need a couple of rules.  First, every ad-hoc code
segment is in an <code>adhoc</code> tag.  Second, an <code>adhoc</code> tag may never be deleted (because the location
finder runs on numeric position in the datasheet).  Third, once activated, ad-hoc code may not be changed, otherwise the
queue will no longer reflect the code being run, and that would be bad.  Other than that, this is easy stuff, but with
very powerful consequences.
<p></p>
Besides just being normal workflow, ad-hoc snippets can do two things upon completion: they can first change the status of
the process by having an "oncomplete" attribute (so that ad-hoc workflow to recover from an error state is simple to set up),
and they can also fill in for a task, so that when the snippet completes, the task is also completed.  That makes ad-hoc
workflow convenient for subplanning without the overhead of explicit subprocesses.
<p></p>
<i>(May 26, 2002)</i> The ad-hoc workflow stuff, while it was weird when I introduced it, turns out to be pretty much exactly
like any old workflow now that I've thought it through.  Who woulda thunk it?
