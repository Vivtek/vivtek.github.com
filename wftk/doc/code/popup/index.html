The popup UI framework started out as a separate project concept, but <a href="..">wftk</a> subsumed it, as it ultimately
subsumes everything I think of nowadays.  The initial project is a simple popup tool for <a href="http://www.proz.com">ProZ.com</a>,
a translation job bidding database through which I find paying work from time to time.  This tool will provide a lightweight
interface to ProZ in order to pop up new job listings, provide a quick query interface for KudoZ questions (these are questions to
fellow translators; it's a convenient way to get translations for sticky phrases), and also provide a quick query interface for
Web-accessible dictionaries such as EuroDicAutom.
<p>
The framework itself is based on <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org">wxWindows</a> and is a simple UI from which
to hang queries and event listeners.  Effectively it is a general IM client, except that instead of handling
a single kind of unstructured message it is capable of handling structured messages corresponding to structured
interactions with arbitrary systems.  (Note that this means it'd make a <i>fine IM client</i>....)
<p>
It is unusual in the wftk in that it is written in C++.  This allows it to interface with wxWindows,
which is a C++ library.  In addition, the window-UI style of programming is indeed a naturally
object-oriented paradigm, so (sigh) I guess I'll go with the flow on this one.  But most
of the meat is in adaptors, and they remain ANSI C.  So there.
<p></p>
The UI does three things, basically: it queries data sources using <a href="../wftk/query/index.html">QUERY</a> and 
<a href="../wftk/connect/index.html">CONNECT</a> adaptors, it listens for and processes
events and query replies using <a href="../wftk/listen/index.html">LISTEN</a> and 
<a href="../wftk/event/index.html">EVENT</a> adaptors, and it stores and lists old messages using 
<a href="../wftk/list/index.html">LIST</a> adaptors in a folder
paradigm.  The reason this is still involved in the wftk is that all these adaptor classes will be immediately useful for
the wftk itself and for its applications.  I'm particularly looking forward to wrapping a very thin daemon wrapper around a
LISTEN adaptor and the wftk library itself and getting a wftk workflow engine daemon as a result.  This will be a Good Thing.
<p></p>
The popup UI doesn't use the wftk library directly at this point; it uses the wftk adaptor code to load adaptors
directly and talks to them instead.  This may change or it may not; for the current application I don't need the
wftk library.  There will later be query and event adaptors for talking to the workflow engine daemon listed above, and at
that point it's going to be possible to do things like putting up screenshots -- people might think wftk is a real program
or something!
<p></p>
At any rate, the five impinging adaptor classes will be where most of the meat of a given popup UI program will be.  That's why
this particular module here is the "popup UI framework."  See?  It all makes sense, doesn't it?  Those adaptors again are as
follows:
<ul>
<li><a href="../wftk/query/index.html">QUERY</a> adaptors for immediate or delayed queries
<li><a href="../wftk/event/index.html">EVENT</a> adaptors for processing incoming events
<li><a href="../wftk/connect/index.html">CONNECT</a> adaptors for talking to external servers
<li><a href="../wftk/listen/index.html">LISTEN</a> adaptors for listening for incoming events
<li><a href="../wftk/list/index.html">LIST</a> adaptors for storing queries and messages
</ul>
<p></p>
That leaves two pages worth of actual program for the framework:
<ul>
<li> <a href="classes.html">Class outline</a>
<li> <a href="implementation.html">Implementation of the classes</a>
</ul>
