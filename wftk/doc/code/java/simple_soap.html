In the interests of bootstrapping ourselves into Java more quickly, Startext (in the person of Dominik Kreutz) and I decided to try running wftk as a SOAP server (see which elsewhere)
and then write some simple SOAP access code in Java to get to it.  After all, we only needed limited functionality on the client, and that much could
easily be wrapped up and sent off to a SOAP server.  The result is this simple_soap class, which is given a function name, a server URL, and some parameters,
builds the corresponding SOAP request as a simple text document, sends it off, then parses the response and provides various ways of accessing the
response data structure.  This class can then be used as the basis for an initial implementation of the wftk class schema; afterwards, we can use the
same class schema to wrap the repmgr library in JNI, giving us the best of both worlds.  It's a pretty slick plan.

So the philosophy of this simple SOAP caller is, well, simple.  We do the absolute minimum required to do HTTP SOAP RPC calls.  Then we'll use those calls
to do an initial implementation of some of the class schema of the wftk.  Then we'll do some application development against it, rinse, and repeat.
Let's include some stuff.  Note we're not going to get all fancy on you here.  We use the xmlapi-j to parse and manipulate our return values, but that's
basically the only import we use.

And down to the code.  To write a SOAP request, we really don't do much beyond finding out a server, a function, and parameters for that function,
which we format as XML and toss over to a server which will actually run the function.  It really is that easy.  Then we get some XML back, which we
have to parse.  Parsing via SAX is pretty simple, once you get past the initial learning curve.

<i>September 16, 2003</i> Added the SimpleSOAPException you see in the first line.  It's about time we got organized with exceptions instead of just
ending up with null pointers here and there.  (You can take the horse to Java, but you can't make him use exceptions until he convinces himself
it's stupid not to.)

At this point, it'd be nice to have someplace to put information about the result.  So.  We'll save the <i>string</i> representation of the XML returned,
yes, but we'll also have nicely Java-ized retrieval things as well.  Barbarian that I am, I simplify the situation by assuming that we have three
kinds of possible return (based on extensive play with the Python test SOAP server): "simple" (which are strings and numbers), lists, and mappings.
Lists will be stored as Java Vectors, and mappings as Java Maps, and a result_type will distinguish among these three possibilities.  And of course the
caller can always retrieve the full reply XML as necessary, in case these simplifications are oversimplifications.  And of course in some cases they
certainly will be: if we have nested lists, for instance.  In that case, the caller can parse the original XML returned and process it as necessary,
and no harm done.  The idea is to provide a toolkit, not a single one-size-fits-all solution.
<p></p>

<i>September 8, 2003</i>: So for complex returns (such as lists of mappings, which happen in task lists) it turns out that SOAP automatically
breaks the XML up into manageable pieces, flattening the return structure.  The pieces are then related with href and id parameters.  So simple_soap
has to reconstruct the original structure recursively.  As it does so, it modifies the original return by copying the referred pieces into their
referrers.

<p></p>
There is some danger here.  Most significantly, if the original XML has href attributes, there will be a collision (I assume).  It may turn out that
SOAP renames these attributes or something, in which case we'll need to unrename them.  Similarly, most of our record-based returns already have id
attributes.  The examples I've seen so far don't, so I don't know what SOAP will do with those that do.  But again, we may need to pre- or postprocess.
<i>September 19, 2003</i>: I'm not sure this is the smartest way to handle it, but I've moved the "xml_assemble" routine into the XMLAPI.  It needs to
be accessible from Java and C alike, so it made sense to implement it in C first.
