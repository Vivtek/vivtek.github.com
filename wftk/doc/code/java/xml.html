This file wraps the <a href="../xmlapi/index.html">XMLAPI and xmlobj</a> libraries which manipulate the data structures
in universal use in the wftk.  It generates two classes, "xml" (which wraps the XMLAPI, but calling an object an "XMLAPI" sounds too
weird), and "xmlobj".
<p></p>

The extra OO goodies that exist in the <a href="../python/wftk.html">Python OO classes</a> don't work in Java, so our wrapper
is somewhat simpler.  However, the greater part of this set of classes is pretty similar; a side-by-side study might be edifying
if you're into comparative philology.

<p></p>
OK?  Here goes.  First, boilerplate GPL language (note to self: use this everywhere else in the project).

Now down to work.  This is really a very mindless task, as all our wrappers are.  The only moderately interesting part is in the C implementation
of the native methods -- and trust me, those are also mindless.  This is one reason I procrastinate wrapper development so much.

First, the imports we'll be using.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>package org.wftk;
import java.io.*;     // For stream interaction.
import java.util.Vector;
import org.xml.sax.XMLReader;   // The following for SAX parsing.
import org.xml.sax.Attributes;
import org.xml.sax.InputSource;
import org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLReaderFactory;
import org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler;

</pre></td></tr></table>

Next, the XMLAPI wrapper class.  Note that file/stream interaction is not compatible between Java and native code (or better said,
it's not all that practical to figure out how to make it so) and so for file I/O I'm going to ignore the existing XMLAPI implementations
and re-implement in Java, later.  Similarly, the use of a foreign copy of expat is a tad silly, so replacing the parsing code with
pure Java (as I've wanted to do in Python already) is also important -- but that can wait a little.
<p></p>
At some point, I should redesign the XMLAPI to segregate data structure
manipulation from (1) I/O and (2) expat interaction.  This keeps coming up in wrapping situations.
<p></p>
<i>A note on garbage collection and <u>close</u></i>: My reading and extensive network of informants leave me convinced that
it is a mistake to rely on garbage collection for cleanup.  Cleanup of native resources should be done explicitly, using a
"close()" method, which I have implemented.  But I still leave room for an automatic close() upon garbage collection, just in
case a caller forgets to close something.  I think that gives us the best of both worlds.

<p></p>
<i>Aug 23, 2003</i>: Just as this was getting underway, we decided to attack the problem from another direction simultaneously;
the result is <a href="simple_soap.html">the simple_soap</a> class, which will allow us to write minimal code in Java while
providing full wftk functionality on a SOAP Web service via <a href="../python/index.html">Python</a>, which effort is more
advanced.  So while we're working on building the native wrapper, this <i>same</i> class will already be starting to transition
some simple functionality into pure Java, starting with the parser, which is built on SAX2.

<p></p>
So all of this leads me to the conclusion that <i>really</i> any given XMLAPI object may either be pure Java, or native.  If the
latter, it will have allocations on the C heap to be managed, and we will mostly call native methods when working with it.  If
the former, then it will consist of Java objects all the way down, with nary a drop of C, and we'll use Java methods to work with it.
If they're mixed...  I dunno.  I'll burn that bridge when I get to it.  Probably we'll end up with a "give me a C-heap tree" call
which will either return the already-existing C pointer or build a whole new tree based on a pure Java structure.  This is the
cleanest way to transition into a mixed Java/C environment that <i>I</i> can think of, anyway.  And it may well be that we'll
end up doing similar shenanigans in Python someday.

<p></p>
At any rate, all this mixedness has one practical upshot: if a native method is still the only implementation of a given API function
(e.g. stringcontent or something) then it will appear with no "xml_" prefix.  If, however, there are both Java and native implementations
of a function, or if a function has no meaning on the Java side (e.g. xml_free) then it will have an "xml_" prefix.  As migration
continues, more and more functions will be duplicated, and in some cases, I have no doubt that the native function will no longer be needed,
since its functionality will have been duplicated in Java.  In all cases, "xml_*" functions are private, so no external code will ever
call them.  This allows us to drop them with impunity once they're no longer needed.

<i>Handles and housekeeping for the XML object</i><br>
Each XML object may either manage an actual tree itself, or it may simply be
a handle into a tree rooted in another XML object.  In the pure-Java representation,
this isn't so much of a factor (since every element ends up being a separate XML object
anyway) but if the tree is a native tree allocated on the C heap, then it's important
that things only get deallocated when we know we're done with them.  Moreover, if the
tree is on the C heap, not every element will have a Java XML object as a handle; we
can think of a few Java handles providing views into a C tree.
<p></p>
The upshot is that we end up needing to know what children we have open so that they
can be properly closed; if no more children are open, and we are closing, then we
need to xml_free the C-heap tree if we have one.  And if we still have children, then
we have to refuse to close until all the children are closed.
<p></p>
This isn't a very clear writeup, but hopefully it will help you understand the
motivation for this housekeeping code below.

<i>August 24, 2003</i>: So I just realized that all along I've been confusing the notions of XML object and handle-into-XML-object.  This has
really hindered development of the whole OO schema.  The handle-parent is <i>not</i> the same as the XML parent of an object.  In fact, a
handle can be considered a navigable view onto a tree -- but to make it work, we need new handle-creation functions.  Here is as good a place
as any to include those.

<p></p>
The "newhandle" function makes a new xml object which is a handle into the current object, while "handle_to" makes the current object a handle
into another object.  The ideal is to keep all handles attached to the top-level object, so both of these traverse the handle tree upwards to
the top before registering themselves as handles.
