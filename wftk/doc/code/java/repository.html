This set of classes effectively forms a client for a wftk server.  The server itself can either be a remote server with which we use some protocol
(e.g. SOAP) to communicate with, or it can be a local implementation of a repository.  Either way, the objects we use to build workflow-savvy code
are the same.  The sane way to implement this in Java is by designing a parent class ("Repository") which is extended by one or more specific classes
("RemoteSOAPRepository" and "LocalJNIRepository").  The parent class may or may not be abstract; I'm going to start with it <i>not</i> being abstract,
and see how far I can get.  Certainly I want to have entries, lists, and such implemented at the level of the parent class and blithely unaware of
the underlying implementation of the repository.  I had originally thought to make those subclasses, but I think that's wrong.  So I changed my mind.

<p></p>
So.  Let's push some boilerplate.

Next up, as always, our includes.  Who knows what'll end up here?

Now down to business.  We define a single superclass, Repository.  This class will be used by classes "list", "entry", and "task", at the very
least, but where we go from there is of course unclear.  For the moment, entries will be assumed to be simple mappings (name->value) and we'll ignore
all refinements like subrecords, list values, attachments, and so forth.  They're only partially implemented here and there anyway, so no great loss.

<p></p>
Here's how I envision this working.  Each function in Repository first does some common work (such as creating an entry object) and then
calls an implementation-specific function or functions in order to do the actual work.  So for "get", we create the entry object and we
prepopulate some of its fields, then we call _get to actually do the retrieval.  At first I was thinking that this class would define some
kind of simple local pure-Java functionality -- but then I reconciled myself to the fact that this is indeed the whole reason for having
abstract classes.  So Repository is an abstract class.  Feast your eyes.
