<h2>wftk: Design and implementation</h2>
[ <a href="index.html">wftk documentation home</a> ]
<hr>

<h3>Overall code organization</h3>
The wftk is a vast and complex system, and its arcane corners are known only to the initiate.  (And that
would be ... me.)  It consists of two central modules, a number of adaptors in various classes, and
several wrappers.  Most of it is compiled into libraries; these libraries
are either statically or dynamically linkable.
<p>
It is implemented (mostly) in ANSI C.  The source code is actually contained in XML files which
are sliced and diced by a Perl script to produce the C code which is compiled.  The reason for doing
this is because the <i>same</i> files contain implementation documentation.  This technique is called
<i>literate programming</i>, and it works for me.  Your mileage may vary.
<p>
The HTML documentation generated during the compilation ends up in the source directories; to make things
easy for a documentation distribution, however, all these files are duplicated in the code subdirectory
here.
<p>
This document is an overview and index; jump to various pieces of it as follows.  The list of interfacing
systems is largely vaporware at present, but it gives you an idea of what goes where.
<ul>
<li><a href="#core">Main wftk implementation</a>
<li><a href="#xml">Data handling in XML</a>
<li><a href="#wrappers">How to call the wftk</a>: Python, Tcl, Perl, C, C++, .NET, VB, Zope, incoming email, etc.
<li><a href="#adaptors">How to get the wftk to talk to other systems</a>: ODBC, Oracle, MySQL, Sybase, outgoing email (SMTP or MAPI), LDAP, etc.
</ul>

<h3>Build organization</h3>
After long years, the build organization on both Unix and Windows is identical.  Of course, under
Windows I'm using a 1999-vintage Mingw32 GNU make to call the Microsoft VC++ 5.0 compiler, but the
principle is the same.
<p/>
There are a number of configuration values in the Makefile.conf file.  The version of Makefile.conf you
retrieve from CVS or from a build will have one of several operating systems selected, depending on
which one I was last testing on when I updated CVS.  So be sure you select the one you're actually
using, first.  The same applies for whether various optional adaptors or front-ends are selected or
not.  Upshot: before you try to build anything, look at Makefile.conf.
<p/>
Yes, I know about autoconf on Unix.  I don't like it, because I'm one of those poor souls who spends
a lot of time trying to get Unix open-source stuff to work under Windows, and autoconf projects never
do.  So it's kind of a personal thing.
<p/>
Anyway, once you have Makefile.conf properly configured, you're pretty much home free. Run make and things
should work.

<a name="core">
<h3>Main modules</h3>
Version 1.0 of the wftk consists of the <i>workflow core</i> (the older of the two central modules),
a number of adaptors, and a thin command-line utility which is mainly useful for testing.  It is not
yet terribly useful unless you're embedding it in your own application code, but despite this handicap,
there are a few people here and there managing to make a go of using it.  This is pretty gratifying.
<p>

After core-v1.0 is released, I'll be polishing up the other central module, the repository manager,
as a sorta-kinda separate product.  Weirdly, the repmgr is the module I'm using more heavily in
production.  The repmgr handles data, and I handle a lot of data, so I guess that makes sense.  The
repmgr will be released as repmgr-v1.0.  Once that's done, I'll integrate the two modules and release
the whole thing as wftk-v1.5.  It will continue to be possible to run the wftk core engine without the
repository manager; this may be useful for embedded systems, etc.
<p>

The relationship between the two central modules, adaptors, and application or wrapper code is
explained and depicted in the <a href="overview.html">wftk overview</a>.
<p>

Both central modules rely on some shared code: the XMLAPI (described below) and the context handling
functionality, which also includes handling of adaptors and configuration information.  Read the
code for more information.
<p>

<u>Central modules, supporting code and command-line utilities:</u>
<ul>
<li><a href="code/wftk/wftk_lib.html">wftk core engine (library)</a>
<li><a href="code/wftk/wftk_util.html">wftk command-line utility</a> (deprecated)
<li><a href="code/repmgr/index.html">repository manager (repmgr)</a>
<li><a href="code/wftk/wftk_session.html">Context, configuration, and adaptor handling</a>
<li><a href="code/repmgr/wiki.html">Repository-aware Wiki(ish) code</a>
</ul>

<u>Alternative implementations (mileage may vary):</u>
<ul>
<li><a href="code/java/index.html">wftk-j: native Java port</a> (approaching initial usability)
</ul>

<a name="xml">
<h3>XML-centric design</h3>
The wftk uses XML-like internal structures for nearly all data.  The library I use to manage these
structure is the XMLAPI.  The XMLAPI is kind of like libxml, except different.  The reason I chose to
do things this way is not entirely because I'm an incorrigible nonconformist; much more importantly,
I thought it would be easier to do a lightweight library than to understand libxml.  Predictably, from
what I've taken the time to understand about libxml, I seem to have re-implemented it almost in its
entirety.  But <i>I had fun doing it</i>.
<p>
The XMLAPI uses the expat parser for all parsing (whether from file or from string.)
<p>
There are three XMLAPI extension modules: <i>xmlobj</i> uses the XMLAPI to do record management for
the repmgr and datasheet management for the wftk core; <i>xml_template</i> does a kind of simple XSLT
for the repmgr; and <i>xmlcgi</i> takes the current CGI environment and builds an XML lookup structure
for easy C/CGI programming.
<p>
<u>XML handling functionality:</u>
<ul>
<li><a href="code/xmlapi/index.html">XMLAPI proper</a>
<li><a href="code/xmlapi/xmlobj.html">xmlobj record management</a>
<li><a href="code/xmlapi/xml_template.html">xml_template template expression</a>
<li><a href="code/xmlapi/xmlcgi.html">xmlcgi CGI environment management</a>
</ul>

<a name="wrappers">
<h3>Wrappers</h3>
I use the catchall term <i>wrapper</i> to mean either a complete program using the wftk, or just a
further library for inclusion into a complete program.  The latter category is really what a wrapper
is in common usage, so please don't be terribly confused by my sloppy language.
<p>
There are thus two types of wrapper, the UI wrapper (a complete program, a category with no members
currently complete)
and the scripting wrapper (an interface for a scripting language, currently represented by Python and Tcl.)
Note that there is a lot of hope inherent in this list.
<p>

 </ul>
</ul>

<a name="adaptors">
<h3>Adaptors</h3>
Of course, there are almost unlimited possibilities for talking to other systems, which is what the
adaptors are for.  There are several adaptor classes; each adaptor class characterizes a set of
methods for talking to other systems in a particular range of needs.  For each adaptor class, there is
one or more implementations -- actual adaptors -- and could be any number of alternate implementations
depending on your needs.  I find that adaptors tend to take me from one to four days to complete, even
if I'm not terribly familiar with the system they talk to.  (The Oracle taskindex adaptor, for instance,
took me four days even though I'd never used the OCI (Oracle Call Interface) before sitting down to
write the adaptor.)
<p>
The wftk core engine uses most of the adaptor classes in this list; the repository manager makes due
mostly with the "list" class, which represents generalized table-like entities with records in them.
Click on each class to get an overview (many of these are out of date, so I apologize in advance) or
on any implemented adaptor to see its code.
