<h3>Issue tracking</h3>
<i>Issue tracking</i> is arguably the core of workflow.  In issue tracking, the description of an
issue (a bug in a programming system, or a problem experienced by a customer) is entered into the
system, tasks are proposed to solve the problem, tasks are completed, and the problem is solved.
Along the way, many variations on this basic plan may occur: the issue may be a standard one, so that
certain tasks are predetermined.  Further requirements may be discovered after a solution is already
underway -- or much later, requiring an issue to be re-awakened (or a new one to be created which
refers back to an old one thought to be solved.)
<p>
There may be one single "customer" (the "user base"),
which is the typical situation for a traditional bug tracking system in software development -- or
there may be many potential customers with many different issues, which is what is generally referred
to as a customer relationship management (or CRM) system these days.  (A CRM must also store general
information about individual customers as well -- but one of the things we know about each customer
is the issues that customer has had, and their resolutions.)
<p>
So a customer relationship management system effectively consists of a single list of issues, each of
which serves as an anchoring point for tasks, and then also permits an optional list of customers.
There are additional bells and whistles which may be attached to this system (such as notification
schemes whereby customers are automatically informed when issues are resolved, or deadline schemes
whereby the priority of an issue or task is at least partially determined by its age and management
is notified when a trigger date is exceeded) but all these are extraneous to the basic work of
issue tracking.  And many issue tracking systems also give users the option of assigning issues to
one or more systems or departments.  Since this relationship is essentially identical to that of
issue-to-customer, I don't see it as extending the model any further.
<p>
<h3>Building an issue tracking system (CRM or bug tracker)</h3>
There will at some point be three links here, as follows:
<ul>
<li><a href="crm_techspex.html">Techspex.com (no-frills bug tracking)</a>
<li>wftk project issue tracker
<li>Despammed.com CRM system
</ul>
My first stab at a wftk-based issue tracking system started on Christmas Day, 2002 (yes, I'm a pathetic
loser and my wife and children are all very understanding of my weaknesses).  To simplify the task given
the absence of many of the modules, I chose to forego multiple customers at first and implement a
pure bug tracking system for my work with <a href="http://www.techspex.com">Techspex</a>, a searchable
machine tool database.  Since I'm the only programmer involved, but the number of issues easily eclipses
my rudimentary organizational abilities, an issue tracking system will be of immediate use.
<p>
I'm going to chronicle that effort <a href="crm_techspex.html">here</a>; this isn't meant to be a
full-featured CRM yet, just a simple bug tracker.  But at some point I'd like to explore integrating
it with CVS (which is what I use to maintain the code versioning between test and production systems
there), for instance.
<p>
Once that system is up and running to my satisfaction, then I'll set up a bug tracker for the wftk
as a whole.  Since the wftk has a more interesting subsystem structure, and since I intend to allow
issues to be maintained <i>using</i> CVS for wftk, I think that system is going to be a lot more 
interesting in many ways.  But it still doesn't address the multiple-customer nature of a true CRM
system.
<p>
So after the bug tracker for wftk is up and running, I'm going to move over to my <a href="http://www.despammed.com">spam
filtration service</a> and set up a bona fide customer relationship management system for spam reporting
there.  Once that's reasonably stable, I can think about ways to build cookbooks for wftk systems of
this type, so that setting up a new CRM can be really simple.
