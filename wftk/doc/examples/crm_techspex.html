<h3>Techspex.com</h3>
Techspex.com is a searchable database of machine tools which has been in continuous operation since
1995.  I started working with them in November of 1995 and have stuck with them ever since, through
their acquisition in the dot-com boom and their subsequent de-acquisition shortly after said boom.
The site is based on AOLserver and the code itself is written in Tcl.  There are two major sections
of functionality; the "site proper," which is the part in operation since 1995 (much modified)
and the searchable
database itself, consisting of about 120,000 lines of code; and the "self-maintenance" portion, started
early in 2002 and now in production, which is a collaborative data management application allowing
the industry community to contribute to accuracy in the database.  The self-maintenance application
is partially wftk-based and consists of about 30,000 lines of really nitpicking code so far, and we've
only addressed maintenance of information about companies (i.e. nothing about machine tools yet).
<p>
Since I'm the only programmer attached to the project, this means I have a lot of issues to keep track
of.  And if you've followed the course of development of the wftk, you know that I'm not the most
organized of people.  So an issue tracking system is a really logical thing to implement for my work
at Techspex.  This page represents a chronicle of my attempt to do this; since much of the implementation
will require development of wftk to work, you can expect progress here to be really spotty.  (But again,
if you've been following the wftk, you're used to that.)
<p>
<a name=basic>
<h3>The basic issue tracking system</h3>
The issue tracking system <i>per se</i> consists of a single list of issues.  Since there is only one
customer, there's no need to track customers.  Since there are only two really meaningful subsystems,
I see no need to muddy the waters by tracking them, either.  So this is an example of what I've been
thinking of as a "simple bug-tracking system," and it's a good place to start working on a real live system.
<p>
I call the single issues list "issues", and I end up with a
site description file like this:
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor=eeeeee><pre>
&lt;site&gt;
&lt;list id="issues" defn="issues.xml" order="priority desc, date"/&gt;
&lt;/site&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></center>
This leaves me to configure the issues list in the definition file issues.xml, which I initially set
up as follows:
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor=eeeeee><pre>
&lt;list&gt;
&lt;field id="id" special="key"/&gt;
&lt;field id="date" type="date" special="add"/&gt;
&lt;field id="expected" type="date"/&gt;
&lt;field id="desc"/&gt;
&lt;field id="notes" type="wiki" rows="10" cols="80"/&gt;>
&lt;/list&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></center>
This gives me an ID which the list adaptor will ensure is a unique key (the special="key" part), a date
which will be filled in automatically when the issue is opened (the special="add" part), an expected
date of completion, a title, and
a general notespace of type="text".  This doesn't mean I can't add arbitrary other data values,
including attached files, as appropriate to each issue, but it does define the minimal set of values
along with some information about how to build an edit screen.
<p>
I also create a directory named "issues" in my main directory; this will store each issue file, which
will be a localdir XML file by default.  Note that I could have chosen a different storage area for the
issues list.
<p>
The "order" attribute on the list definition defines the default order for issue listings.  This could
be omitted entirely to save some overhead, but it makes a lot of sense to use it, especially once we
get into publishing below.
<p>
The notes field is a "Wiki text"; it is edited as a textarea (with the rows and columns as specified
in its field definition) but formatted as structured text.  My inspiration for this was the WikiWikiWeb
concept which you can easily find in Google; the point is to make it simple to produce formatted text,
links and all, without typing HTML.  In my structured text setup, skipped lines are paragraph breaks,
asterisks introduce links, and so forth.  True to wftk form, I haven't yet documented this (partly
because I expect it to remain in flux for a while.)  The point is that the notes are designed to be
quick ways to create formatted content.
<p>
So far, time expended (ignoring the time I'm taking to document this) has been under ten minutes.  <i>If</i>
I had a fully functional front-end, I'd really already have a simple issue tracking system, because the
wftk already supports tasks against objects (like issues), indexing of tasks, and so forth.  But I don't
have a front-end yet, just pieces of them.  Let's talk about the front end a little.
<p>
<a name=frontend>
<h3>Front end planning</h3>
Presentation of issues can be seen in terms of use cases, more or less as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>System status</b>: Techspex management or I can get a quick overview of active issues and their relative priorities.
<li><b>Issue status</b>: Techspex management or I can view a particular issue and see its history, notes, etc.
<li><b>Issue creation</b>: Techspex or I can create a new issue
<li><b>Issue resolution</b>: I can mark an issue as resolved
<li><b>Issue modification</b>: Techspex or I can add new data or notes to an issue, or change its priority
</ul>

Of these, the status pages can easily be thought of as either live database queries or as published
static HTML pages.  Since I haven't involved a database with this system yet, that leaves me with
published static HTML pages.  I'll want to create two publishers which will be called whenever the
list of issues is changed.  The first will be a list template to publish a sorted list of all active
issues; the second will operate for each issue and will publish a static representation of that issue.
The static issue page will also include hooks for actions to be taken.
<p>
I kind of like this model for active site development.  Information that doesn't
change often can be written a single time and then handed out to many viewers with only minor processor
overload.  This would, therefore, scale very well.  But it still permits the normal navigation of the
data to be used to find items to modify and actions to take, so that (active) users of the site needn't
keep two pictures of the data in their heads at once.
<p>
A second advantage of static HTML (or other static data representations, like an XML file of some sort)
is that it lends itself to publishing on some system other than the one actively hosting the bug
tracker.  In the Techspex case, this doesn't apply, but it can be seen as a distinct advantage.
<p>
At any rate, the front end for this system breaks conveniently into two portions: static HTML publishers
for system and issue status pages, plus active maintenance code to make actual changes to the issue
list.  The first is well-supported by code current in December 2002, while the latter category is only
spottily supported -- at the moment, it is partially addressed by the CGI front end, but that's the
extent.  So as part of this exercise, I'm going to address myself first to fixing up the CGI front end
sufficiently to work for this system, but I'd also like to start laying out a native AOLserver front end,
since that's the HTTP server used by Techspex and thus I'd like to use it in other Techspex applications.
<p>
<a name=publishers>
<h3>Publishing static HTML for system status</h3>
Let's go ahead and define our publishers for the issue list.  This is really pretty easy; first we define
two pages to provide a place for the publishers to publish to, and then we provide the publishers.
We modify the site.opm file to look like this:
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor=eeeeee><pre>
&lt;site&gt;
&lt;list id="issues" defn="issues.xml"/&gt;
&lt;page id="issues" page="index.html" displays="issues"/&gt;
&lt;page id="issue" page="issue[id].html"/&gt;
&lt;publish id="issues" from="issues" to="issues" defn="index_template.xml"/&gt;
&lt;publish id="issue" from="issues" to="issue" defn="issue_template.xml"/&gt;
&lt;layout id="default" defn="layout.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/site&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></center>
The pages could be used for a navigation interface, but since we only have one datasource that'd be
fairly pointless.  So instead they just provide a place to define the URL used by each publisher.  The
publisher elements define the dataflow in this system, which is strictly from the single list into
two sets of pages (one of which happens to be a single page.)  The layout defines the overall
HTML template to be used for all pages on the site; again, this system involves so few pages there
would be no point in being more sophisticated with layout types.
<p>
Note that the page value for the page "issue" contains square brackets like this: <code>issue[id].html</code>.
This is something I call a flat template (because it's not an XML template like the ones we're about
to define below) and it gives us a simple way to specify how to build a filename for the static HTML
file associated with any particular object: we simply replace <code>[id]</code> with the value of the
"id" field for the object.  Nifty.
<p>
The "displays" attribute on the issues page is there to tell the CGI data management interface that when
displaying the full list after modification, it should use that page.  This allows the published page to
be an effective center for navigation when editing the list.
<p>
So now all we have to do is define three templates: the overall site layout, the issue list template, and the
issue detail template.  Since this system isn't really for public consumption, there's very little
reason to pretty it up, so I'm going to keep all of this to a bare minimum to make it easier to see
what's where (and also to save me some development time.)
<p>
All layouts are effectively <i>templates</i>, that is, they are XML which is run through the
xml_template library and then written using xml_writehtml, which makes sure, for instance, that the XML
element <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> gets turned into <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> and the like.  Slots in the
templates are filled using template:value elements.  For the general layout, there is one slot named
"content" defined by the system; that will be the default target of whatever page is published.  A
layout may also optionally define other value slots, which can be filled in using a couple of different
mechanisms, only one of which I'll be using here, to fill in the title slot.
<p>
Here's the general layout:
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor=eeeeee><pre>
&lt;layout type="page"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;&lt;template:value name="title"/&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#000099" vlink="#990000" alink="990000"&gt;
&lt;template:value name="pagetitle"/&gt;
&lt;template:value name="content"/&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/layout&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></center>
This gives us three slots for each page: a title slot, which is just going to be a value; a page
title slot, which will contain some formatting for the title (because I don't want the index page
to look exactly like an issue page); and finally, the content itself, which will be filled in with
whatever is appropriate for the page at hand.
<p>
We have two different basic kinds of page here; one lists entries from a list as a table, while the
other publishes an individual object.  A list template must contain a <code>template:list</code>
element, which will connect with the list in question, retrieve it, order it, and proceed.
<p>
The list template is the longest file I've quoted yet, but it's still pretty easy to understand:
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor=eeeeee><pre>
&lt;list&gt;
&lt;template replaces="title"&gt;Techspex issue tracker&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;template replaces="pagetitle"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Techspex issue tracker&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;template&gt;
The Techspex issue tracker lists active issues.  Click an issue to see or
modify it.
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="eeeeee"&gt;Priority&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="eeeeee"&gt;Date entered&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="eeeeee"&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;template:list order="priority desc, date"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;template:value name="priority"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;template:value name="date" format="date"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;template:value name="desc" format="link:issue[id].html"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/template:list&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;template:value format="link:repmgr_cgi?mode=new&amp;amp;list=issues"&gt;Add new issue&lt;/template:value&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></center>
Note in particular that the top-level element of this template is <i>not</i> a "template" element, but a
"list" element, denoting that it is a list of templates.  The individual templates are then used to
replace the values of the slots in the layout; if a template is not named, it is assumed to be the
content template and will replace the content value in the layout.  Clear as mud, right?
<p>
Order in list retrieval is specified using an SQL-standard order specifier.  If the underlying storage
is an RDBMS, then this spec is used directly when building the query; otherwise, it's passed to the
xmlobj_list_sort function by non-RDBMS adaptors.
<p>
When we insert a single test task into the list with the above index template, the result looks like this:
<center><img src="crm_t1.png" border=1></center>
<p>
For the detail, we build a similar very simple template as follows:
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor=eeeeee><pre>
&lt;list&gt;
&lt;template replaces="title"&gt;Techspex issue &lt;template:value name="id"/&gt;: &lt;template:value name="desc"/&gt;&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;template replaces="pagetitle"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;template:value name="desc"/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;template&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ID:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;template:value name="id"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Priority:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;template:value name="priority"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Date entered:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;template:value name="date" format="date"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan="2"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Notes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;template:value name="notes"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;template:value format="link:repmgr_cgi?mode=edit&amp;amp;list=issues&amp;amp;key=[id]"&gt;Edit this entry&lt;/template:value&gt;
&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Back to list&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></center>
Again, this template is a list of three templates to cover our three layout slots.  The layout of this
detail is pretty boring, and there is as yet no specification of tasks to be done, history, attachments,
or indeed much of anything, because there isn't much code there to format any of that.  That will be
forthcoming soon, I hope, but it's a wftk "soon", so it may be a year before I really get down to it.
<p>
The test task referenced above ends up looking like this:
<center><img src="crm_t2.png" border=1></center>
<p>
This much gives us a basis for working with the system, even if there is as yet no mature Web interface to
manage data; to date, when using the publishing code of the repository manager, I either enter the
data by hand through the repmgr command-line interface plus a text editor invoked by the CLI, or I
generate the data using Perl scripts running on the system, and simply use the repmgr "publish" command
to run off a set of pages showing the current state of the system.  I can use either of those
approaches with this system as well.  But naturally, a Web interface for data management will make
the system far, far easier to use.
<p>
<a name=datamgt>
<h3>Data management interface (adding/modifying issues)</h3>
Even though my heart wants to build a native AOLserver interface for this system, my head is telling
me there's no chance I'll get around to that in a timely fashion.  So instead I'm going to recycle the
repmgr CGI interface, which is already half-done as of this writing (December 2002).  I'm hoping that
using this system on a more or less daily basis will motivate me to make improvements to the CGI
interface (most of which will probably be easily wrapped in Tcl to create an AOLserver-native version.)
<p>
The issue detail above links to repmgr.cgi
to "Edit this entry" -- that and the analogous "Add issue" link on the index page are our means of
entry to the data management interface.  Beyond making sure that a CGI symlink is present in the repository
directory, there's nothing more to specify in order to provide CGI access to the system.  Once alternative
front ends are available, they will likewise be precisely this easy to set up, since they all work off
the same site definition file we use for publishing information.  At most we need to set configuration
parameters (like the "displays" attribute on the index page) in order to modify the default way in which
a front end works.

<a name=resolution>
<h3>Resolving issues and archiving resolved issues</h3>
At first glance, resolving issues is simple -- we just delete the issue.  However, this really isn't a great way
to handle resolution, for two reasons (neither of which is that the CGI interface doesn't delete things yet as
of this writing).
First, when a list entry is deleted, the publisher doesn't remove the file
it was published to.  If someone has bookmarked the page, a fresh visit won't tell them that the issue has been
resolved; it will simply have vanished from the master list of open issues, leaving a fossil detail page in place.
Moreover, deletion doesn't provide
any history at all -- when was the issue resolved?  How long did the resolution take?All in all, maintaining a
database of only active issues is a weak solution.
<p>
The best way to handle this is to build a state machine for the issues list.  If we have two states (say, "active"
and "resolved") then we can specify archival when the issue reaches the "resolved" state.  Archival moves the object
into a second list, where it can be published using completely different templates, if necessary.  This is rather
handy, since the template for a resolved issue can be made visibly different, making it easy to see that something
has changed.
<p>
The list template for resolved issues can also publish to a separate page, and can sort by something other than
priority -- say, by resolution date.  And if we specify the archival list with an "add" date, it will automatically
mark the date of resolution of the issue.
<p>
Another benefit the state machine gives us is that we can define more states -- for instance, we could define an
"emergency" state for an issue.  The emergency state could be triggered by an automatic process which scans
active issues for signs of neglect, and entry of the emergency state could notify management, or page a senior
developer, or ... whatever.  The "whatever" is the whole point of a workflow toolkit, after all.

<p>
To set all this up, we add a new list "issue_archive", and define the state machine for the issues list.  Both of these
are done in site.opm (although the state machine could just as well be defined in the defn file for the issues list,
issues.xml -- the definition is merged with the information already in site.opm, so it doesn't really matter where
we define the state machine.)  The resulting site.opm, which is getting a little more ungainly as a simple example,
looks like this:
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor=eeeeee><pre>
&lt;site&gt;
&lt;list id="issues" defn="issues.xml" order="priority desc, date"&gt;
&lt;state id="active" label="Active"/&gt;p
&lt;state id="urgent" label="Urgent"/&gt;
&lt;state id="resolved" label="Resolved" archive-to="issue_archive"/&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;
&lt;page id="issues" page="index.html" displays="issues"/&gt;
&lt;page id="issue" page="issue[id].html"/&gt;
&lt;publish id="issues" from="issues" to="issues" defn="index_template.xml"/&gt;
&lt;publish id="issue" from="issues" to="issue" defn="issue_template.xml"/&gt;

&lt;list id="issue_archive" defn="issue_archive.xml" order="resolved desc"/&gt;
&lt;page id="issue_archive_list" page="old_issues.html"/&gt;
&lt;page id="issue_archive_detail" page="issue[id].html"/&gt;
&lt;publish id="issue_archive_list" from="issue_archive" to="issue_archive_list" defn="archive_template.xml"/&gt;
&lt;publish id="issue_archive_detail" from="issue_archive" to="issue_archive_detail" defn="archive_detail_template.xml"/&gt;

&lt;layout id="default" defn="layout.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/site&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></center>
I slipped in an extra state "urgent" just to show where it might go; if you wanted to use that, you'd have to display
it in some way by modifying the display templates for the issues list, plus you'd probably want to sort on the state
in order to have urgent issues float to the top of the list.  But I don't want to spend time on that right now.
Similarly, I'm not going to show you the templates for the issue_archive list, because they're essentially the same as those
for the issues list.

<p>
The "archive-to" attribute on the resolved state indicates that this state is a sink -- that is, when
the object hits this state, it will be moved entirely into the issue_archive list.  An archival state
circumvents any workflow attached to an object, and archival removes all active workflow (or at least,
these statements will be true once the integration of the repository manager with the wftk core is
complete.)  However, the addition to the new list can invoke whatever workflow is required in the
context of the new list.  From a state-machine point of view, an archival transition can be seen as a
compartmentalization of the state machine into manageable submachines (one per list.)

<p>
The issue archive has no state machine, and thus cannot transition back to the issues list.  There's a case to be made 
either for the ability to bring an issue back to life by making it an active issue, or forcing the system to create a
new issue instead -- I've opted for the latter, mostly because it's simpler.  It could easily be changed, of course, 
by defining an "archiving" state machine for issue_archive.



<a name=cvs>
<h3>Interaction with CVS</h3>
Since I manage the code for Techspex.com using CVS, I'd like some integration between CVS and the
issue tracking system.  The real question is what form this integration should take; I have a number of interesting
possibilities, none of which are actually working yet.

<ul>
<li>Tracking of code changes made in response to issues (and conversely, issues prompting each code change.)<br>
    This would effectively mean that wftk would access the CVS logging functions and store informative information
    about events in CVS, and it's a reporting feature.  This would link "cvs diff" to active issues, which would 
    involve some extra accounting overhead while programming.  The obvious way to deal with this would be for a
    cron job to check "cvs update" periodically and make sure there are no changes which weren't accounted for;
    if new changes were detected, then they'd go into a task list of "stuff to resolve".  This would augment the
    list of current issues with a shorter list of "active issues" -- issues attached to currently changed files
    which haven't been committed yet.
<li>Actual commit and/or putting into production of code changes upon issue resolution.<br>\
    Since I run two versions
    of the Techspex site (one with a sandbox set of code for pretesting changes, and the actual production site),
    code gets checked in and moved into production after an issue is resolved.  This would utilize the code-change-to-issue
    link from above.
<li>Resolution of issue upon code commit.<br>
    This works in the other direction, of course -- if I commit a code change or set of changes, then it would be
    equivalent to the resolution of the issue.  This could be done in either of two ways.  If we want to build a
    Web interface to the resolution/commit system, then that system would do whatever's necessary.  But sometimes
    it's convenient to use CVS from the command line, and in this case it would be dangerous to allow commit without
    some way to close out active issues for consistency's sake.  So it would be nice if we could use CVS's commitinfo
    or loginfo hooks to take appropriate action when a code file is committed.  (It would be even nicer if we could
    initiate workflow on such a commit, and officially commit the file only upon approval, but that will require some
    more finicky work than what I'm talking about here.)
</ul>

Anyway, eventually I'll get around to exploring all this.  Watch this space for further details.

<a name=more>
<h3>Where from here?</h3>

There are naturally an infinite number of features which one can incorporate into any system, and the bug tracker (even the
simple one!) is no exception.  I haven't had much time to write anything down, but eventually there will be more.
