<h3>The sections of a wftk system</h3>
A typical wftk application is built around a <i>repository</i>,
a set of data sources and a description of their relationships.
Each record in a repository list is potentially a workflow-enabled object,
meaning that the system registers tasks against it which must be completed
by human beings or by queued program code.  (Tasks are themselves stored in the _tasks list
in the repository.)  When a task is completed, or when some other
workflow-active event occurs in the system, then the system invokes
a workflow interpreter on a process definition in order to find out
what must be done next.
<p>
The wftk system itself is broken into two major segments of code, the <i>repository
manager (repmgr)</i>, which manages the data objects in the system, and the
<i>wftk core engine</i>, which manages the purely workflow aspects of system operation,
including the interpretation of process definitions.
Each of these major modules interacts with external systems by calling functions
grouped into <i>adaptors</i>, which can be seen as software drivers.  Many adaptors
are shared between the two major modules, while others have meaning only in one
context or the other.

<i>Warning</i>: This document describes the goal state of wftk.  For version 1.0, only the
core workflow engine is included, in a "wftk-bare" mode.  The repository manager and core engine have
not yet been integrated as shown in the diagram below; this will be happening during July 2002 or I'm
just going to shoot myself.  (Current note: this integration didn't happen in 2002, but it's largely finished.)
After release of wftk core v1.0, I'll be releasing repmgr v1.0.  Subsequent
integration work will probably be released as wftk v1.5.

Application code interacts with wftk using either the repmgr API or the wftk core API;
however, since the repository manager itself knows how to invoke the wftk API
in response to various
events, a workflow-oriented system may have no need at all to invoke the wftk core API directly.
For applications which want to do pure workflow without the overhead of repository management,
the wftk core is carefully independent of the repmgr.  The "wftk core" is in fact the version-1.0 distribution
of the wftk; at present the repmgr is only available via the CVS repository.
<p>
The repository manager adds a great deal of logic for formatting text and building Websites;
this code can also be used to maintain other "unstructured" text using the structured data sources
making up a repository.  There is code derived from the Wiki Wiki Web paradigm which allows
plain text to be processed into a formatted layout, enabling content producers to ignore
formatting completely in many cases while writing, but still preserving their ability to affect
formatting explicitly when they need to.
<p>
For more information on the workflow aspect of the wftk, see the <a href="background.html">workflow
backgrounder</a>; it's got a fairly good presentation of what workflow is and what it can do for you.
The beginnings of a new set of application examples are in <a href="examples/index.html">the wftk
application section</a>.  There, it should soon be more apparent what wftk really is, and note that
many of these examples are really repository-manager examples.
<p>
There aren't many examples of application code yet, besides the command-line utilities wrapped around
the repmgr and the wftk core.  There is a popup window framework coming up which talks to the
repository manager, and there are the Python wrappers for embedding repmgr and the XMLAPI into Python
programs (a nice combination with Zope or wxWindows).  There will be more.  For a list of the
things I'm working on right now in wftk, see the <a href="todo.html">to-do list</a>.  For a list of
all the things that are <i>working</i> or in process, see the <a href="code.html">code overview</a>.
