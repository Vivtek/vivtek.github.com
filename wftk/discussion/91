<P>&gt; Hi,
<P>&gt; Just saw you post on Zope.org about possibly integrating wftk with Zope.
<BR>> Any news on the front? Have you had the time/effort?
<P>Still working on v1.0. The beta release will be tomorrow. I really wanted it for today, being Friday the 13th, but eh, that's life.
<P>THEN I can start thinking about wrappers, like CGI and Zope. But it's coming along.
