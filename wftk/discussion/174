<P>Hi,
<P>I need a workflow engine that will be accessed from a web content management framework build in Java (J2EE). The options are now to implement a simple engine, buy a commercial one, find an open-source implementation (which isn't available in Java) or use an open-source implementation as an example.
<P>On your &quot;on the horizon&quot; section I saw you mentioned a migration to Java/EJB. Have you allready given this more thought? I think a lot of people will be interested in an open-source workflow engine in Java because you can use it in a wide range of applications and there's no implementation yet.
<P>TIA Michael
