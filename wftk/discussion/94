<P>Has anyone managed to build the new 0.9 beta on Unix (specifically Linux)?
<P>I want to use WFTK as the basis of a simple task management system for our devteam - we're outgrowing the basic 'tasks' table + some web pages concept I threw together a year ago.
<P>I'm working through the problems, but if someone's already done the hard work I'm interested.
<P>So far:
<P>1) Fixed line terminations (gcc didn't like the CRLFs)
<P>2) Fiddled with the Makefiles for expat and xmlapi to fix some linker errors.
<P>They build, but the test program in xmlapi doesn't produce any output
<P>when I pipe in text.xml
<P>Now I'm tinkering with the wftk files; wftk_internals produces a compiler error on line 13. My C is rusty, so I'm off to find the documentation for typedefs.
<P>
