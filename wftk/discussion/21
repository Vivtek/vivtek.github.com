<P>&gt; Most often they expose some API for getting/setting the WF properties and
<BR>> move tasks along. I'm not aware of any that have anything that could

<P>One possibility is using the Jabber platform as an external messaging infrastructure - Jabber is basically a modular XML processing engine with instant messaging being the first thing they used it for. Modules that interfaced to other workflow and/or non-workflow systems could be built, and the client code could be integrated into this project..... hmmm, this could be interesting!
