<P>&gt; What are the ideas regarding the presentation layer? It seems natural to
<BR>> extend the XML definitions of a flow with the XML/XSLT presentation
<BR>> generation. For example Velocity or indirect to tools like Jetspeed.
<BR>> Thoughts/comments?
<P>Well, there are really two parts to presentation: task management and procdef presentation. The procdef manager from the prototype is a CGI-based application and way too monolithic, which is why I've shrunk from recoding it to work with the New Era.
<P>As you can see from the task management stuff, though, the lists return XML pieces -- I'm working out template-based ways to turn that into pages. I tend not to get really excited about most tools, because they seem to be too heavy for what they deliver, but certainly something XSL-like is in the cards.
<P>That's where I'm coming from at the moment, anyway.
