<P>&gt; I figure I have about 12 full days left before I can call version 1.0
<BR>> ready. This week I *hope* to have the first bits of it done, and I'll try
<BR>> to set up a CVS server, now that things are squared away.
<P>The library is just about ready to roll. This includes a command-line interface that exposes a lot of the basic wftk functionality. Better than nothing. I really wanted to have a release today, but it's going to be tomorrow.
<P>
