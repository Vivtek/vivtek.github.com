<P>&gt; Can I do this with a shell script only?
<P>Yes, that's my testing mode at present.
<P>&gt; Now what?? It is time for the Supervisor's Approval to happen. How do I do
<BR>> it?? What action is needed to select from an &quot;option&quot; list?
<BR>> Tried wftk set &quot;Approval code&quot; Yes. Didn't work.
<P>Should be wftk set . 5 &quot;Approval code&quot; Yes -- but I think that's what you meant.
<P>&gt; &quot;wftk tasks . 5&quot; shows me that &quot;10: Approval
<BR>> [Supervisor]&quot; is an outstanding task.
<P>&gt; How do I initiate the &quot;Approval&quot; task?? Still totally
<BR>> &quot;blocked&quot; on &quot;Approval&quot; task. And the containing
<BR>> sequence. And the containing workflow. Totally blocked.
<P>The task is already there, and active. So you need to complete it:
<P>wftk complete . 5 10
<P>For verisimilitude, you'd be a user:
<P>wftk -u mrsupervisor complete . 5 10
<P>In a &quot;real&quot; interface, the task's associated data items would be updated at the same time the task is completed. The command-line interface doesn't support that, which is why you have to call wftk set a whole lot.
<P>Does that make sense?
