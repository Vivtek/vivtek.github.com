<P>&gt; Hi,
<P>&gt; I'm planning to build an application. It'll be either in Delphi/Interbase
<BR>> or Apache/Java/MySQL. Has anyone made wftk work in these 2 environments?
<BR>> How? Any pointers would be very appreciated. Thanks a lot!
<P>To work with Interbase, you'll need to write an adaptor; the MySQL adaptor, on the other hand, should be ready pretty soon (yeah, I've been saying that for a while.) On the flip side, running from Delphi should be relatively straightforward, as I believe Delphi can work with a DLL with no particular problems, but to run under Java you'll want to write a JNI wrapper or convince me to do so. I could be convinced, really.
<P>For both environments, you'll probably find some of the formatting machinery useful which I've been working on -- unfortunately it's not quite ready for release, but if you give me an idea what you're trying to do, I can probably work up a reasonable response to it.
<P>
