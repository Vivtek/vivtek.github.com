<P>&gt; I just started with the Solaris download yesterday. Don't trust me. I'm
<BR>> new to this. Neverthelss, here goes. (Sticking my neck out.)
<P>This is exactly correct.
<P>Actually, this coming week I'm going to be starting a datasheet storage repository based on Oracle. The &quot;same thing&quot; should work with MySQL, and I hope to parallel develop with PostgreSQL as I go, as I like PostgreSQL a lot for most of my projects.
<P>I guess I could install MySQL and try to do all three at once. We're only talking about a day's work or so.
<P>(But the Oracle one, that's being paid for. Aaaah.)
<P>&gt; In
<BR>> WfTK, a file, once written, is not updated, though it may be deleted.
<P>? Where do you get that? The localxml dsrep adaptor, like any dsrep adaptor, writes on a call to wftk_process_save.
<P>&gt; It is straight-forward to map this structure onto a relational database in
<BR>> the obvious way: Tabletype=&gt;recordid=&gt;textfield. The textfield would
<BR>> be either TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT or LONGTEXT in MySQL. The Oracle CLOB would be
<BR>> better.
<P>Exactly.
<P>&gt; The concurrency semantics are a bit different, however, files vs. RDB
<BR>> tables. But database concurrency is probably closer to what you want for
<BR>> WfTK anyway.
<P>Agreed.
<P>&gt; However, neither directory/files nor relational/tables will scale
<BR>> gracefully to very large numbers of objects (when complex objects are
<BR>> implmented this way).
<P>While I'll agree on the filesystem end of that assertion, I'd like to see some references for the same assertion pertaining to databases.
<P>&gt; Not sure if WfTK needs transactions.
<P>Still too stupid. It would depend on how you wrote your dsrep adaptor, really.
<P>&gt; Lastly, before using MySQL, have a look for an open source XML Store.
<BR>> Might be one. Dunno. If you find one, it would be more natural than MySQL.
<P>And if you find one, I'd like to get a pointer as well. Thanks!
<P>
