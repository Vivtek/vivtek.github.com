<P>Well, ok, I take it back about the source comments not being useful! They are.
<P>BTW, when can we expect to see a PHP module? That would be great.
<P>&gt; Hi,
<P>&gt; I would love to see a short example on just how to do a simple workflow.
<BR>> Something like: (See post &quot;Purchase Request: Just do it ??&quot;)
<P>&gt; wftk create 5 wftk define . 5 . chair wftk set . 5 &quot;Reason for
<BR>> request&quot; &quot;I want one&quot; wftk set . 5 &quot;Product
<BR>> requested&quot; &quot;Leather Chair&quot; wftk set . 5 &quot;Requester's
<BR>> email&quot; &quot;email@www.example.com&quot; wftk complete . 5 wftk tasks
<BR>> . 5 wftk set . 5 &quot;Approval code&quot; Yes wftk complete . 5 10
<P>&gt; That would really help people get started (more so than the source
<BR>> comments!)
