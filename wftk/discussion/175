<P>You can use www.google.com to find it. I have find it in a zip file: &quot;XSL and PHP 4.1.zip&quot;, try it.
<P>&gt; Hi,
<P>&gt; I tried to run the binaries and also compile the sources supplied. I am
<BR>> struck with an error as expat.dll not found.
<P>&gt; Is there something missing in the distributions? I have perl installed at
<BR>> another location where I found an expat.dll. Placing this at the location
<BR>> does not seem to help.
<P>&gt; All help is appreciated.
<P>&gt; Thanks
