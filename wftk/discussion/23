<P>&gt; As Josh already mentioned there is Zope and Python. Currently there is a
<BR>> discussion thread in the Zope mailing list
<BR>> (http://lists.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev) and in egroups:
<BR>> http://www.egroups.com/messagesearch/zope?query=Workflow, discussing
<BR>> Generic Workflow. I am convinced that it would be a great shift to build a
<BR>> Workflow product on Zope with Python. There is already a small basis of a
<BR>> workflow, but maybe we could pull together the resources.

<P>Actually, I'm currently learning Python. As Python is typically extended with plain-vanilla C modules, and as the new and improved wftk (which hasn't hit stores yet) is reimplemented as a set of libraries, I think that it's going to be really simple to drop the engine into Python and Zope. That'll be my next trick.
