<P>&gt; What it takes to make wftk work under Apache?
<P>The new version will support completely CGI-mode, so it'll run under anything. I'm still sticking to AOLserver (er, OpenNSD) for closer integration and higher performance but the CGI version will have the same functionality.
<P>Estimated time of arrival: two weeks. I've made great strides in the last week or so.
