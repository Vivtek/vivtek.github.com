<P>I completely agree with Matt Hicks. Wf-XML is just a very basic (u. maybe non very mature) DTD to exchange messages between engines.
<P>&gt; I've looked over the Wf-XML and (correct me if I'm wrong) the standard
<BR>> deals exclusively with communication between WFMS, not actual process
<BR>> definition. Has anyone seen process definition in the standard where I
<BR>> have not?
<P>&gt; On a similar note, it would be nice to see the XML for process definition
<BR>> in wftk resemble more closely the Interface 1 standard of the WfMC. If
<BR>> that were the case, the process definition interface for wftk might then
<BR>> instantly be capable of producing definition that any WfMC Interface 1
<BR>> compliant WFMS could interpret (not that I know which MFMS are).
<P>
