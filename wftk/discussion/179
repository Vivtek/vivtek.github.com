<P>&gt; Can i use WFTK in Visual Basic6? If yes, how?
<P>The answer is yes, but you have to define some wrapper classes around the DLL. It may be somewhat challenging to get everything working correctly, but it'll work -- it's the same, in principle, as the Python wrapper.
<P>I have VB 5.0. Things *should* be source-compatible, so assuming I get the time to hack out an initial VB5 wrapper, would that be of any interest to you? I suppose you'd just import the project into VB6 or something.
