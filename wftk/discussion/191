<P>Hi,
<P>I'd like to help testing it. Once the thing is setup I think I can help coding additional stuff.
<P>Were would you like to start discussing which standards to use, which components to implement, how to implement pluggability with additional functionality and components, etc.?
<P>Maybe a new sourceforge project? One other thing: the last few weeks a few of open-source workflow-like or workflow-containing projects have been presented at TheServerside. There was a talk of joining forces. I think it's a good idea to start exploring possibilities this would have?
<P>HTH
<P>Michael.
<P>&gt; So, OK. I'm biting the bullet. I'm going to port this beast to Java.
<BR>> Anybody interested in (1) critiquing interim results or (2) helping me out
<BR>> financially during the development stage or (3) just plain being nice to
<BR>> me should do so as opportunity allows.
<P>&gt; This should be a piece of cake.
