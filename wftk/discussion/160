<P>Hi. I am using IBM MQSeries Workflow which can import and export to a standard Flow Definition Language (FDL), or the more general Workflow Process Definition Language(WPDL). I do not find any reference to such a definition language in the wftk documentation or material. Any plans to implement an interface to include WPDL/FDL compatibility?
