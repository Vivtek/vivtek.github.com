<P>&gt; Since procdefs are written off-line and since not everyone wants to read
<BR>> the code to learn how to write one, it would be nice to post up a DTD for
<BR>> this XML, with some comments describing the procef semantics.
<P>Yes, yes it would.
<P>After two months of pounding this last release out, though, for no particular reason than to see it through, I really needed a break.
<P>A while back, people were yapping because I wanted to wait for a really release-ready point to publish anything. Now people yap because I put up something that's incomplete. The lesson I'm taking home from open source is that people will just yap no matter what I do.
<P>Meanwhile, I'm still not done yet. If you want to help, great. Otherwise, please try to keep the vitriole to a minimum, because between my two kids, my wife's
and my graduate work, and running a consulting business, I have enough stress
as it is.  Thanks.
