<P>Sorry, I don't check the wftk discussion board as often as I need to. Things have been *very* busy around here.
<P>I've given J2EE lots of thought, yeah, but I have yet to find anybody to foot the bill while I develop it. In your situation, a JNI wrapper might be sufficient, although I'd really like to see a parallel native Java implementation. If I only had the time!
<P>
