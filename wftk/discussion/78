<P>Michael,
<P>I finally got back to see what you've been up to. I'm no longer doing workflow here. (They apparently got tired of me pointing out that their pet system still isn't working.) However, I'm still interested in the OS wftk and I'll try to drop by periodically to keep up.
<P>I also just downloaded the wftk Windows version. Hopefully I won't blow up my computer trying to run it. :)
<P>C-Ya!
<P>Dale
