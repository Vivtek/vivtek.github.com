<P>Hi!
<P>Just came across WFTK... Ive been looking for an open-source workflow engine for some time. I have a few comments though...
<P>1) A large, developement-intensive system should not be built in a unmanagable language like C++. Possibly you should consider Java or Python. Python would be great because you could integrate the workflow engine into Zope- a python-based app server. If the engine were built in a more user-freindly language, more people could participate in development. Another plus for python: most python developers are dedicated people, mainly because no one who is &quot;in it for the money&quot; would learn python, because it cant make you any money.
<P>2) Could someone reccomend a good book on workflow systems? I need to learn more. Ive been involved with Verve and Vitria before and I see major potential for workflow systems- and i need more info.
<P>thanks, Josh Zeidner
