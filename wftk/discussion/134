<P>&gt; I've looked over the Wf-XML and (correct me if I'm wrong) the standard
<BR>> deals exclusively with communication between WFMS, not actual process
<BR>> definition. Has anyone seen process definition in the standard where I
<BR>> have not?
<P>&gt; I completely agree with Matt Hicks. Wf-XML is just a very basic (u. maybe
<BR>> non very mature) DTD to exchange messages between engines.
<P>There is a new Document availiable from wfmc that specifies a:
<P>Workflow Process Definition Interface -- XML Process Definition Language.
<P>which makes it possible to standardized exchange/create Process Definitions for workflows-systems .. perhaps it is worth to have a look at:
