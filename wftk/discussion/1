<P>OK, on the advice of Linas Vepstas I've started an onsite bulletin board (well, Linas actually suggested a mailing list hosted at SourceForge, but I want control over the archives.) When I publish the core engine, you'll find that I already have a separate board for that.
<P>Please -- make suggestions, ask questions, whatever. Offer to help. Knock yourselves out.
<P>The software is ancient, I know.  It's WebBBS some version or other.  I just happen
to have it lying around and it's easy to install.  Later, who knows?  I may roll my own
BBSware.  In the meantime, let's all try to overlook the clunky old table look.
