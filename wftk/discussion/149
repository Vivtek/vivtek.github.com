<P>&gt; since the command line util fetch parameters word by word, so it cannot
<BR>> recognize single parameter composed of multiple words, like &quot;Approval
<BR>> code&quot;, so i cannot set the value of some data, so the work process
<BR>> cannot flow.
<P>Use quote marks. The command-line interpreter (i.e. DOS or sh) does this, not wftk.
<P>&gt; is it possible to post a demo script showing the whole process of
<BR>> executing a demo workflow (ordering a chair), it must be a bit helpful.
<P>Yes, I intend to do that as soon as possible.
