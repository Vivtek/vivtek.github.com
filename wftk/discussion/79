<P>&gt; Michael,
<P>&gt; I finally got back to see what you've been up to. I'm no longer doing
<BR>> workflow here. (They apparently got tired of me pointing out that their
<BR>> pet system still isn't working.) However, I'm still interested in the OS
<BR>> wftk and I'll try to drop by periodically to keep up.
<P>&gt; I also just downloaded the wftk Windows version. Hopefully I won't blow up
<BR>> my computer trying to run it. :)
<P>Perish the thought.
<P>Well, what I'm up to isn't on the site yet. Although I've had 537 downloads of wftk this *week*...
<P>Thanks for sticking with me, Dale! I'm just about ready to bring out wftk v1.0, (yes, yes, I've been saying this for a while, but I just finished a large ongoing contract, so I've got time for a change.) It's much better stuff.
<P>
