<P>&gt; Thanks.
<BR>> but I tried command
<BR>> wftk set . chair &quot;Approval code&quot; yes
<BR>> several times, but I just failed everytime.
<P>Unless you created and defined a process which has the id &quot;chair&quot;, this is failing because the process doesn't exist.
<P>wftk create . chair wftk define . chair . chair wftk set . chair &quot;Approval code&quot; yes
<P>OR
<P>wftk create . (message: Process 1 created, or whatever) wftk define . 1 . chair wftk set . 1 &quot;Approval code&quot; yes
<P>Does that make sense? Sorry for the delay. This board has so little traffic I often forget to check it.
