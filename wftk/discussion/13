<P>&gt; Does anyone know a XML dtd where i can give an entire program in XML which
<BR>> can later be converted to java/vb/tck etc.
<P>&gt; regards Nagaraj.
<P>If you want to write XML which describes a program, then is compiled to source code, I encourage you to take a look at LPML, which is the tool I'm using to develop and document wftk. I suspect that's at a lower level than what you're looking for, though. I suspect further that you're out of luck. But I wouldn't mind hearing about it if you find anything.
