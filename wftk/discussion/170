<P>Hi,
<P>I tried to run the binaries and also compile the sources supplied. I am struck with an error as expat.dll not found.
<P>Is there something missing in the distributions? I have perl installed at another location where I found an expat.dll. Placing this at the location does not seem to help.
<P>All help is appreciated.
<P>Thanks
<P>Jaikrishnan
