<P>Hi Micheal,
<P>Firstly, congrats on the WFTK project. It's much appreciated.
<P>I have just discovered your project and I think I need to go through the info on your site (the scenarios etc) before I can understand how and when to use WFTK. Problem is I pay for the time I'm online so it would be great if I could download an archive of the new and old sites to read offline.
<P>Thanks,
<P>Kunle
