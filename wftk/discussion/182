<P>&gt; Some times ago, you put interesting introductive page about workflow, with
<BR>> a chair purchase sample, as an XML document and a homemade DTD.
<P>&gt; I don't find these pages anymore ?
<P>Yeah, I need to get back into the historical documentation of the prototype and dust off the useful parts. The usage scenarios are what you're looking for, starting at http://www.vivtek.com/wftk/usage_scenarios.html and the chair in particular is at http://www.vivtek.com/wftk/usage/chair.html -- sorry about that.
