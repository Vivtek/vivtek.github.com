<P>As Josh already mentioned there is Zope and Python. Currently there is a discussion thread in the Zope mailing list (http://lists.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev) and in egroups: http://www.egroups.com/messagesearch/zope?query=Workflow, discussing Generic Workflow. I am convinced that it would be a great shift to build a Workflow product on Zope with Python. There is already a small basis of a workflow, but maybe we could pull together the resources.
