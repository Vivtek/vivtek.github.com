<P>Michael,
<P>Hi, you my remember as the guy who sent you some Air Force workflow requirements drafts and mentioned you in an article on workflow I wrote for the Navy about three years ago. I got curious and decided to see if you're still working on wftk. Glad to see you're still at it. :)
<P>I retired from the Air Force in 2001. I'm doing telecomm for Homeland Security now. I'm not currently involved in any workflow stuff, but you never know how the winds will blow. I'll make a note that you're still around and see if I run into anyone who might be interested.
<P>C-Ya!
<P>Dale Long
