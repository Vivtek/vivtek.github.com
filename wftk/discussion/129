<P>&gt; I guess I could install MySQL and try to do all three at once. We're only
<BR>> talking about a day's work or so.
<P>Great looking forward to that.
<P>&gt; And if you find one, I'd like to get a pointer as well. Thanks!
<P>Well regarding this XML-store I'm not sure. There are a bunch of OSS XML persistent stores out there - most notably http://www.dbxml.org. Now I thought that wftk is more a state machine than anything else. If so the amount of data required to update is limited. I take the overhead of storing an XML doc in an rdb initially to ensure that I don't have two persistent stores to manage.
<P>Comments?
