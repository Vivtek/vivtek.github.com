<P>&gt; Has anyone managed to build the new 0.9 beta on Unix (specifically Linux)? Howdy!
<P>I was hoping to get to a Solaris build today -- but if you can possibly wangle me a test account via telnet/ssh on your server, I'd be ecstatic. I don't have access to another Linux box at the moment.
<P>I haven't tried the xmlapi test programs in a while, so they may well be broken. I should look at that as well. I spent so much time getting to this point that I've been revelling a bit in not being quite so driven. :-)
<P>There's a lot of work to be done to get to a robust build, but it won't take too long.
<P>Michael
