<P>&gt; It is not. I happen to share your opinion of C++; the core components of
<BR>> the wftk are written in C and will continue to be written in C. The code
<BR>> is clean and well-documented, and it frankly just isn't complex enough to
<BR>> warrant objectification. (But I'll avoid that soapbox. I've worked with
<BR>> enough object-oriented code to know that crap is crap even if it's
<BR>> object-oriented crap.)
<P>&gt; Java lacks the portability I need, and Python, while attractive, lacks the
<BR>> performance. That said, I will almost certainly be working on a Python
<BR>> extension utilizing the C code of the wftk -- thus bringing the Zope crowd
<BR>> a little closer to my part of heaven.
<P>&gt; I submit that there are far more C programmers than Python programmers in
<BR>> the world today, and for the foreseeable future. Java I won't talk about,
<BR>> that's a holy war.
<P>&gt; Most open-source developers in general fall into that category. I don't
<BR>> think Python people have any particular edge in that respect.
<P>&gt; I will say, though, that I've been getting into Python (specifically
<BR>> wxPython for cross-platform GUI development) and I really like it.
<P>&gt; But I do need to ask you -- have you browsed the code? Do you really find
<BR>> that less readable than Python?
<P>&gt; If somebody knows about a good book, I'd like to hear about it as well.
<BR>> The problem is that workflow is such a high-money item that nobody wants
<BR>> to sell their knowledge as cheaply as a mere book.
<P>Most of the litrature about WfM is only available as articles. Good Sources are
<P>The LDIS Lab http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/lib/lib.html
<P>The university of Klagenfurt http://www.ifi.uni-klu.ac.at/Publications
<P>Publications of Wil van der Aalst (Recommended &quot;The Application of Petri Nets to Workflow Management&quot;) http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wsinwa/publications.html
<P>The university of Ulm http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/dbis/papers/
<P>Good Books:
<P>S.Jablonski, C.Bussler: Workflow Management : Modeling Concepts, Architecture and Implementation (But this book is out of print)
<P>Stefan Jablonski, Markus Böhm, Wolfgang Schulze : Workflow- Management. Entwicklung von Anwendungen und Systemen. (Only in German)
<P>That should be enough to start.
<P>&gt; Thanks for the interest!
