<P>Hello, my name is Leopoldo Cicero, I just would know if I need AOLServer 2.1 to run WFTK ; if I need it, could someone send me it ? I looked for AOLServer on its website, but the only version available is the latest (3.xxxxx), and WFTK is incompatible with the latest version, it runs only with version 2.1.
<P>If someone can send me by email AOLServer 2.1 (or can tell me where to get it...), i will tell him an email address of mine with sufficient storage space. Thanks in advance for your attention.
