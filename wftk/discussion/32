<P>Hello,
<P>I think this is a great project! I'm mainly a Java programmer, but I've done a fair amount of C and C++ in the past. My current work is all in Java, and I've just realized I need some sort of workflow system, preferably open source, and there isn't really anything else out there... Is there anything I could do to help create a Java version?
