<P>Try this correct link instead.

<P>Don't ask me why this really stupid thing happens; when I initially started designing my site it made sense; since then it makes less sense. Suffice it to say that &lt;pagex&gt;.html is the same page as &lt;pagex&gt;/index.html -- except that links don't work the same. Duh. Like I say, at the time it made sense. I was young and stupid.
<P>So, for the several of you who have attempted to follow my instructions and download, ahem, I'm really <i>normally not this stupid</i>. Fortunately, since earlier this week I've had the opportunity to sleep a little.
