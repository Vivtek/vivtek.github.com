<P>&gt; I have been all over your site, and have not yet figured out how to get a
<BR>> copy of your source code. At our company we are very much interested in
<BR>> your work, and might even invest some time and energy towards a Java
<BR>> implementation.
<P>&gt; Most open source projects have the source code ready to download in a zip
<BR>> file, whether it is compilable/runnable or not. If that is not available,
<BR>> then at least anonomous CVS access is available. On top of that, the GPL
<BR>> mandates that the source must be obtained in a downloadable state.
