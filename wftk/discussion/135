<P>&gt; Michael, congratulations on getting this far. I'm looking forward to the
<BR>> Zope integration. Let me know if you need help or testing.
<P>Hi! Testing will be great! I just wrote an article (my usual exploration method) on extending Zope, so I'm ready to start... I've also got a paying customer to whom I've justified wrapping the XMLAPI in Python (for a wxPython app) so that gets me started. Bit by bit I'm getting there.
