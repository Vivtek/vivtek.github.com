<P>Hi!
<P>Thanks for putting together wftk! Looks great - I'm trying to find out if I can use it a project. One of the key things I need to do is use MySql as a datastore. How would I go about that? Or in general how would I use a JDBC persistent store? Don't see to much info on this in the config.xml
<P>Thanks!
<P>-Dirk
