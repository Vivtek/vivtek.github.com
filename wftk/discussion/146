<P>&gt; while i try to compiling the files contain in taskindex directory. the
<BR>> error message suddenly display at monitor.
<P>Whoops! Modify the build.bat file in the TASKINDEX directory to eliminate compilation of the TASKINDEX_oracle adaptor -- that's looking for the Oracle include file (oci.h). Sorry about that. I don't yet have much of a configuration procedure in place, do I?
