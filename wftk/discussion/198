<P>&gt; HI I want to alter the wftk mailing system by attaching some file to the
<BR>> mail. Can you please help me with this??
<P>I assume you mean that you want to attach files to outgoing notifications, right? To be perfectly honest, I hadn't thought of this. What a nice idea. How little time I have to devote to it at the moment. I will, however, greatly relish adding it to the to-do list....
