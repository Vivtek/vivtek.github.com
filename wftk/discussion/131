<P>I want to run the chair_b.xml procdef from the command line interface:
<P>Can I do this with a shell script only?
<P>Or, do I need to use an &quot;action&quot; script?
<P>The difference being (I think) that the action script would perform multiple tasks within the same session.
<P>I did &quot;wftk create&quot; to make a new datasheet. WfTK tells me it is &quot;5&quot;.
<P>Then I did &quot;wftk define . 5 . chair&quot; to associate &quot;Purchase Request&quot; procdef (not really just for chairs) with datasheet 5.
<P>Then I did &quot;wftk set . 5 foo bar&quot; 3 times for the 3 open data items. Just filling in a &quot;form&quot; or, as it is called in wftk-land, a &quot;datasheet&quot;. Same thing. Cool.
<P>Then I did &quot;wftk complete . 5&quot; to start the process defined on the datasheet. This being the &quot;submit&quot; for the &quot;form&quot;.
<P>Now what?? It is time for the Supervisor's Approval to happen. How do I do it?? What action is needed to select from an &quot;option&quot; list? Tried wftk set &quot;Approval code&quot; Yes. Didn't work.
<P>&quot;wftk tasks . 5&quot; shows me that &quot;10: Approval [Supervisor]&quot; is an outstanding task.
<P>How do I initiate the &quot;Approval&quot; task?? Still totally &quot;blocked&quot; on &quot;Approval&quot; task. And the containing sequence. And the containing workflow. Totally blocked.
<P>
