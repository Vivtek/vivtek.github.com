<P>since the command line util fetch parameters word by word, so it cannot recognize single parameter composed of multiple words, like &quot;Approval code&quot;, so i cannot set the value of some data, so the work process cannot flow.
<P>is it possible to post a demo script showing the whole process of executing a demo workflow (ordering a chair), it must be a bit helpful.
<P>sth like
<P>wftk create . chair
<P>wftk define . chair chair
<P>wftk user . chair cy
<P>wftk role . chair Supervisor cy
<P>wftk complete . chair
<P>.
