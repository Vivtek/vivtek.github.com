<P>&gt; Which is beter for production use?
<P>OpenFlow is more mature. I think wftk is more flexible. So which is better depends a lot on your particular application.
<P>Moreover, if you're working in Zope, you're almost certainly better off using OpenFlow, even though I grit my teeth while saying this, because they've been working with Zope for considerably longer than I.
