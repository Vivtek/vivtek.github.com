<P>Regarding to java based workflow toolkit, I suggest you to explore Java version of ACS Workflow from Arsdigita.
<P>They have a lot of module, workflow system also included. They have Demo Server: http://www.pinds.com:8081/
<P>From tcl based system, Arsdigita is going to Java based system.
<P>--Budi Wiyono
<P>&gt; What it is, is the workflow functionality. What it isn't, yet, is any kind
<BR>> of GUI. It's also in C, not Java, although it's fairly small, actually, so
<BR>> that porting shouldn't be terribly difficult.
<P>&gt; I've had quite a lot of interest for an EJB version, actually, and I'm
<BR>> really extremely interested in doing it or at least helping significantly
<BR>> if you're really focussed on doing it yourself -- but I just don't know
<BR>> much Java. I've dabbled in it, but frankly, I'm not sure where to start
<BR>> with beans.
<P>&gt; You can get a lot of insight into what wftk can do by looking around the
<BR>> documentation for the prototype, which is at
<BR>> http://www.vivtek.com/wftk/prototype.html
<P>&gt; I'd appreciate any kind of feedback into what would be required for an EJB
<BR>> version.
<P>&gt; Aha -- I see as well that you're interested in a graphical procdef editor
<BR>> in Java. Me, too. Take a look around the prototype documentation. I just
<BR>> haven't had the time to get serious about updating the documentation to
<BR>> cover the release version.
<P>&gt; Thanks for the interest! Michael
