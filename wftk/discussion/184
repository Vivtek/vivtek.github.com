<P>&gt; This is a general question for scripting environments, actually -- I think
<BR>> the answer is a qualified &quot;no&quot;. The question is really &quot;how
<BR>> can I write adaptors in a non-C language&quot;, right? The answer depends
<BR>> on the language. If your language can create a DLL, then you're basically
<BR>> already finished; the Windows version of the wftk can dynamically link to
<BR>> it as required. That's assuming you have a compiled language (which I
<BR>> believe is possible with VB, right?)
<P>&gt; The other possibility is that you have a special &quot;Python wftk&quot;,
<BR>> say. I realize this isn't relevant to you, Prashanth, but it might be
<BR>> relevant to others. If you have the wftk embedded in Python, ideally you'd
<BR>> like to be able to include support for adaptors written in Python. I
<BR>> haven't really tackled that yet, but it seems that in *that* case you'd
<BR>> want a smarter wftk_get_adaptor, *or* you'd have something like an
<BR>> &quot;adaptor wrapper&quot; which would provide a go-between. So I'd
<BR>> specify a data storage adaptor as python:something, and do something in
<BR>> the config file to ensure that the adaptor wrapper would know what in
<BR>> Python to execute, and then things should work transparently. I think.
<BR>> Since I haven't actually done it yet, I may be wrong, but that's what I
<BR>> have in mind. Eventually.
<P>Hi,
<P>Can you send me a source code? I'm trying make a WFTK work with VB, but i unknow how. Please, if you can, send for my e-mail: andre@multiplaconsultoria.com.br
<P>Thank You
