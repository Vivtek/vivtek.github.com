<P>Hi there,
<BR>> If somebody knows about a good book, I'd like to hear about it as well.
<BR>> The problem is that workflow is such a high-money item that nobody wants
<BR>> to sell their knowledge as cheaply as a mere book. yeah ! But why stick with commercial stuff ? Workflow Management is a highly interesting research area. (so do I) There's a lot of good research papers on workflow management.
<P>maybe you should start with: An Overview of Workflow Management: From Process Modeling to Workflow Automation Infrastructure, by Dimitrios Georgakopoulos and Mark Hornick
<P>Can be found at http://nt-labes.icmsc.sc.usp.br/alunos/dti/wdl/workflow/
<P>Have fun Heiko
