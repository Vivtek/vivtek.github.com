<P>&gt; Actually, I'm currently learning Python. As Python is typically extended
<BR>> with plain-vanilla C modules, and as the new and improved wftk (which
<BR>> hasn't hit stores yet) is reimplemented as a set of libraries, I think
<BR>> that it's going to be really simple to drop the engine into Python and
<BR>> Zope. That'll be my next trick.
<P>I'm a big fan of Zope/Python and am ecstatic to see that you have put everything into libraries! When those libs are available, I'll start work on building a Jabber module to implement workflow, (see also http://www.vivtek.com/wftk/discuss.pl?read=21)...
<P>This is gonna rock!
