<P>this idee of workflow manager in open-source is great . thanks a lot for your job. the best is in your documentation when you explain your experience , it s help a lot to understand your work . and it s a lot better than a simple API javadoc like in a lot of similar project.
<P>but , there is always a but ... , in some page IMG links are broken and this is a shame .
<P>Congratulations .
