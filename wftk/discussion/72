<P>This project is really interesting. I would like to learn both EJB and workflow engine. Have you ever consider putting the workflow engine with EJB? I have done some research and www.jboss.com have an open source for EJB. I believe that TCL and Python both have java version. I have played around with EJB a bit. The idea for EJB is really cool although I am not quite sure about the performance. I would like to help if you want to convert to EJB. I will spend both weekend and weeknight to work on this project.
<P>Do you have any suggestion for me who wants to learn the workflow engine? I have done some research regarding the workflow engine. It consist 3 parts. The 1st part is the workflow design part. The 2nd part is the process enviornment and the 3rd part is the run time environment. I have to admit that I am new in both workflow and ejb programming. Let me know if I can help. Also give me some guideline on the best way to learn the workflow. (I may need to read your code. :)
