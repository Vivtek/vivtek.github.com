<P>&gt; Very cool. You've clearly put a lot of thought into this!
<P>Thanks.
<P>&gt; Performance is usually pretty straightforward to solve, but there may be
<BR>> more subtle architectural issues that prevent wftk from working in this
<BR>> context, so I'll ask. Do you think that wftk would be useful for this sort
<BR>> of computer-driven workflow, or is it better suited for more traditional
<BR>> business workflow?
<P>Absolutely. One of the most important points for me is that wftk embodies a scripting language with the ability to express human intervention. In other words, when something goes wrong, things don't just break, or log an error and die -- they tell you what's up and you can fix it and everything goes right along. No data is lost because everything's in the datasheet, accessible and documented.
<P>The beauty of workflow is that you can represent human decision-making with it -- but it's still automation. So even though this isn't what the current paying customer is paying for, I've been giving a lot of careful thought to that aspect. I can easily see processes which happen very quickly and completely automatically 99% of the time, only escalating to human intervention when necessary. Man, can I see it. Hoo-boy, sysadmin work will never be the same. Just give me five years.
