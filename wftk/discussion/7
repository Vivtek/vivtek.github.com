<P>Any chance of you setting up a mailing list instead? I'm interested in tracking progress, but there is zero chance I'm going to come back and monitor the web bbs, let alone tolerate for long its funky interface.
<P>egroups and sourceforge do it for free; if you want total control, someone like pairlist.net will do it relatively cheaply (you'll have to get a thowaway pair account, but you get the idea).
<P>btw, i presume you are looking at the latest wfmc may-1 wf-xml binding? (not that i'll see your response unless you email me....)
<P>thanks.
<P>-mda
