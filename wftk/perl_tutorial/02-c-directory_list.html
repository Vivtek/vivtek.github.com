<p>
</p>
<p>Our next variety of data storage is still in the local filesystem, but this time we represent each record with a separate file in a given directory.</p>
<p>There are two basic ways we can look at files.  The first is simply as blobs -- in this mode, the file contents themselves are effectively a large
binary field which we consider opaque.  This comes in handy for attachment storage, for instance, and document management.</p>
<p>The second basic mode is to regard the contents as encoding a record.  Since the Workflow::wftk::Record class has lots of ways of parsing data into
records, this can be a very flexible way of organizing relatively small amounts of data in situations where we don't have a relational database
available, or when some external process is generating files in a directory for some reason and we simply want our workflow system to get at them
and use them.</p>
<p>There is one quirk of the directory storage class, however, which will come up later, as well: it draws a distinction between ``SQL fields'' and
``record fields''.  The reason for this is simple.  When we look at a directory, we can immediately see the name of each file, its size, and its
creation and modification dates (depending on the operating system) -- that's because this is the information which is stored in the directory
structure itself.  Only by laboriously opening and reading each individual file can we get information about file contents.</p>
<p>So when the unaugmented directory storage mechanism is asked to do an SQL query, it will only have access to what information it can get from
the filename, size, and dates of the files.  None of the other files defined in the record is accessible to SQL.  The only way to get around that
is with an <strong>index</strong>, which we will cover in section 02-g Indexing.</p>
<p>The directory fields (ID, filename, size, and modification date) are stored as <em>metadata</em> for the record.  
When we retrieve a record, however, we get the entire record's data, parsed (if the list is a parsed list).</p>
<p>In some cases, if we've defined a filename structure for a record, we can get some fields by parsing the filename.  In this case, the class will
do its best.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="storing_recordbased_data_in_a_directory">Storing record-based data in a directory</a></h2>
<p>The basic functionality of the directory storage class is pretty close to that of the memory and file classes, except for the distinction between
SQL fields and full record fields, which we'll cover in the next section.  First, let's look at the basic access; it's just like the other list
types we've seen.</p>
<pre class="code">
   use Workflow::wftk;

   my $wftk = Workflow::wftk-&gt;new();

   # Create a list stored in 'test_d':TCH 
   my $list = $wftk-&gt;open('mylist', 'dir:test_d');

   # Add a record the easy way, with a hashref.
   my $key = $list-&gt;add ( {field1 =&gt; 'value1', field2 =&gt; 'value2'} );

   # Look at the fields in the list again:
   @fields = $list-&gt;fields();          # Returns ('field1', 'field2') now, just like a memory list.

   my $key2 = $list-&gt;add ( ['different value', 'value2'] );
   my $key3 = $list-&gt;add ( ['third value', 'value2'] );

   # Get a list of keys:
   my @keys = $list-&gt;keys();

   # Let's check what we just did:
   opendir IN, 'test';
   my @files = grep !/^\./, readdir (IN);
   closedir IN;

   # @keys and @files should be the same thing.

   # Iterate through the list:
   for (my $key = $list-&gt;first_key(); $key; $key = $list-&gt;next_key()) {
      # ...
   }

   # Get a record:
   $rec = $list-&gt;get($key2);

   # Get a value:
   print &quot;Value is &quot; . $rec-&gt;get('field2');

   # Modify an existing record.
   $rec-&gt;put ('field1', 'new value 1');
   $list-&gt;mod ($key2, $rec);

   # Delete a record.
   $list-&gt;del ($key3);

   # Note that $list-&gt;as_text WON'T WORK, because the contents of the records are not cached in memory
   # (they are presumed to be too large).  Use an index if you need contents all at once.

   # Display the contents of the file:
   system 'cat test_d/1';

   # That (if you're running Unix) will print this:
   # field1: value1
   # field2: value2
</pre><p>Again, remember that you have plenty of ways to address directory lists beyond the ones I'm showing you here.  The entire machinery of the wftk
is at your disposal for any type of list, including directory lists.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="reading_directory_metadata_using_sql">Reading directory metadata using SQL</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, in comparison with the memory and flat file lists we've seen so far, retrieval of a record from a directory is relatively expensive.  To permit
SQL queries on the actual data would require us to open and read each individual file in the directory -- almost certainly something we don't actually
want to do.  So the basic directory list doesn't support it.  (If you really want to do this, you have to set up an index for this purpose. Since the
index can just as well be an in-memory list, you're not actually losing any performance; the only cost is a little extra coding and awareness.)</p>
<p>But even though we don't have access to the actual data for each record, 
we still have metadata (the filename, file size, modification date) which is easily
and quickly accessible, so we allow SQL to access those metadata fields as true fields for the purpose of querying.  This gives us the ability
to read directory listings and manipulate them in useful ways.  When we actually retrieve a record from the list, we get its fields, with the metadata
still accessible as ``meta fields''.</p>
<p>(The upshot of this is that the direct string value of a directory list is basically useless; it simply shows a list of keys.  Instead, to get a quick
tabular string, we select * from the list, running the metavalues through SQL to turn them into values.  This process is shown in the example below.)</p>
<p>In addition to the ID, filename, size, and modification date, we can also specify for a given list that the filename itself is built of certain
of its data fields.  If that's the case, then we may be able to reverse-engineer those data
fields back out from the directory listing -- in this case, those
fields are also accessible to SQL and stored as meta fields in the final record.  We'll address this feature below, in subsection ``Composite keys''.</p>
<p>In the last subsection, we left a directory list in ``test_d'' with two records inserted.  Let's do a little SQL with them.  Note: for a directory list,
SQL can't see data fields, just metadata, so INSERT will have no effect.  At some later date, it might make sense to allow modification of the access
date, but that's probably about it; you don't want to be able to change the size of files, for instance.  (That is, if you <em>do</em>, you probably don't
really need to do it from wftk SQL.)  All that's a long-winded way of telling you that this section isn't going to include an INSERT statement.</p>
<pre class="code">
   use Workflow::wftk;

   my $wftk = Workflow::wftk-&gt;new();

   my $list = $wftk-&gt;open('dirlist', 'dir:test_d');  # Open the directory as a list.
   $wftk-&gt;do (&quot;select * from dirlist&quot;);              # Select everything.
   my $result = $wftk-&gt;list();                       # Get the result back as another list.

   # Now the fields in $result are 'id', 'filename', 'size', and 'date', instead of those being meta fields,
   # and we can use as_text() to get a quick string for convenient display.
   print $result-&gt;as_text;

   # With a two-step process, we can select records newer than a particular date and do
   # something with each.

   foreach my $id ($wftk-&gt;sql_get_list (&quot;select id from dirlist where date &gt; '2009-04-01'&quot;) {
      my $rec = $list-&gt;get($id);
   }
</pre><p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_restricting_the_files_made_visible_to_a_list">(Restricting the files made visible to a list</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, instead of treating all the files in a directory as one list, we want to store multiple lists in the directory, or we simply want to have
other files in the directory that won't be used by wftk at all, but still shouldn't show up as records.  For instance, we might want to keep image
files in a directory along with XML files describing each one; in that case, the list itself might be restricted to just files marked as XML files, and
the others would remain ``invisible'' to the list.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_composite_keys">(Composite keys</a></h2>
<p>Up to this point, all the keys we've used in every list have been sequential numbers automatically generated by the system.  While that's often the
most convenient way to work, sometimes we want our keys to have meaning.  We call those <strong>composite keys</strong> because they're composed of other values.
Even a composite key will normally have a sequential component, though, just to prevent the possibility of collision.</p>
<p>We specify a composite key by supplying a key format to be used on a record to generate its key.</p>
<p>Composite keys work in two directions, or at least they sometimes do.  We can always use a format to generate a key, but it's also very useful
to be able to use an existing key to come up with the field values used to generate it.  But be careful!  To make this possible, your key format
has to delimit the fields in a way that can be used to extract the fields.  If you have two text fields next to one another with no delimiter,
for instance, there's no way to tell where the first ends and the second begins.</p>
<p>Composite keys are particularly useful for directory lists because it allows us to read some identifying fields from the directory (e.g. the file
names), so we can do some SQL queries on them.  But you can use a composite key for a list stored anywhere; the feature is not specific to directory
lists.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_treating_file_contents_as_attachments">(Treating file contents as attachments</a></h2>
<p>Normally, a parser is invoked on record content (as in the first section), causing the file contents to be read as fields (or in some other way, as
shown in the next section).  But we can also tell the list <em>not</em> to do that, instead just treating the entire contents of the file as one big
field, generally calling it an attachment.  Obviously, this is usually going to be used in conjunction with some other list to store other data
fields.  This feature forms the basis for <em>document management</em>, which has an entire section (02-j Document management) devoted to it, but here
is how it is used in its most basic form.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_using_alternative_record_parser_dumpers_in_a_directory__e_g__xml_">(Using alternative record parser/dumpers in a directory (e.g. XML)</a></h2>
<p>The last subsection showed you how to turn off field parsing for the contents of a directory -- but perhaps you simply want to parse your records
in a different way, like with XML.  Here's how you do that.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_keeping_attachments_and_data_files_in_the_same_directory">(Keeping attachments and data files in the same directory</a></h2>
<p>Getting back to our example above of keeping image files in a directory with an XML data file for each one, let's set that up.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_keeping_attachments_in_a_directory_but_data_in_a_flat_file">(Keeping attachments in a directory but data in a flat file</a></h2>
<p>With just a slight modification, though, we can put the data into a flat file, and keep the attachments in the directory as before.  The flat file
can either be in the directory itself, or elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is the first and most basic mode of combining the advantages of flat-file storage and directory storage.  Flat files can store lots of
fields in a convenient structure, but not very large items of data (well, unless you want crazy-looking flat file content and even worse performance
than using the file system will already give us).  The natural way of doing things, then, is to store the smaller fields in the flat file,
and use a directory list for storage of attachments.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_using_a_directory_attachment_storage_for_record_supplementation">(Using a directory attachment storage for record supplementation</a></h2>
<p>What if our flat file has a restricted set of fields, but we want to supplement those fields with all the larded-down W::w::Record goodies?  No problem;
we can define an attachment to hold ``the rest'' of the fields.  This is another feature that's convenient for supplementing RDBMS records with extra
data structures.</p>
