<div class="title">Open source</div>
<div class="date">Published 2008-07-14</div>

<p><em>Originally written April 8, 2000, by the date stamp on the file; commentary added June 23, 2008, then a very little more in 2020.</em></p>

<p>Against all sane expectations, open source is recently quite the buzzword.  Why?  What the heck
is it, and how does it differ from traditional corporate software development?</p>

<p>Well, the short answer is: an open source product is provided in such a way that users of the
software can find and fix their own bugs.  It is organized in such a way that fixes can easily
be incorporated into the main code, and that people can easily join or leave the group without
affecting the flow of information much.  In other words, <strong>open source has a very robust
development model</strong>.  It can evolve very, very quickly, and it can get as nearly bugfree as
software can get, simply because the people actually using the software are empowered to
detect and fix errors.  [<em>Note 2008-06-23: So far, I still agree with all this.</em>]</p>

<p>Sounds great, doesn't it?  Well, it is.  There's just one sticky wicket: it stems from a culture
radically different from American capitalism.  The open software movement originated in the
hacker culture of the 70's, and that culture is a gift culture.  In fact, the original "free
software" movement was radically anti-commercial in its philosophy, and it's still not unusual
to see licenses on free software that precludes commercial use (or demands special licensing for
commercial use.) [<em>Note 2008-06-23: remember, this was written in 2000.  I haven't seen anti-commercial
licensing since the GPL became widespread, but it was originally rather common.
I stand by my cultural distinctions.  There are, of course, some people making money off open-source software.
Lots, actually. But open-source will not, and cannot, create corporate behemoths with billions of dollars, such
as Microsoft. You can't be as honest as open source demands and still market for the money Microsoft demands.
Can't be done.</em>]</p>

<p>However, things are changing -- Linux and Mozilla have proven the legitimacy of the open-source
concept for American business.  Now everybody's trying to figure out how to do business on an
open-source basis.  Uh, wait.  How do you give things away and still make money?  Well, nobody's
quite sure about that one.  [<em>In 2008, everybody's pretty sure that the answer is "services".</em>]
There are a number of models which are being tried out, but if you
want my opinion, it's this: open-source businesses will never be very large.  A large corporate
structure simply will collapse under its own weight if it is forced to the high degree of
honesty required by an open-source model.  [<em>2008: Looks like I flubbed this one to a certain extent,
because "making money giving things away" is a bit of a straw man.
I still say a large corporate structure and honesty are fundamentally incompatible.  Also, my business failed in 2004
because I was thinking 1. Develop, 2. ???, 3. Profit.
The lesson to be taken away is that open source is a software development strategy, and is very much not a business plan.</em>]</p>

<p>I'm starting to see some new ideas out there in the "capitalist open-source" market.  The obvious
idea is a matchmaking service, whereby corporate (or other moneyed) sponsors can post requests
and hire developers to implement them.  I'm participating in two of these: SourceXchange
and CoSource.com.  SourceXchange was the enabler for my
wftk project and is geared towards projects roughly in the $10,000 to $15,000 range.
CoSource has a much simpler project model and is really geared towards projects in the $500 to $1000 range, but
I'm currently working on a proposal there for a $7,500 project.  Each site is definitely worth
watching.  [<i>Of course, they died.</i>]</p>

<p>So how do you really start up an open-source project?  Eric Raymond, one of the prime movers of
the open-source culture, has a few very salient points in his essay <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">
the Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>.</p>

<p>But here is my short interpretation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with a problem that is interesting to you and hopefully to others.</li>
<li>Write or find a halfway decent solution to this project.</li>
<li>Find the people that need this solution.</li>
<li>Set up your infrastructure.</li>
<li>Respond to any and all questions and suggestions.</li>
</ul>


<p>What you need to do is to create a community of technically capable people who are using the
product.  If you do this, and if the community is stable, then your product will evolve
very quickly and become quite robust.  This is the "bazaar" metaphor for open source.  (The
opposing concept, the cathedral, typifies the closed shop: instead of a messy, noisy, open
structure going in ten directions at once, the cathedral is quiet, attended by cloistered monks,
and attempts to look perfect at the cost of not changing very often.)</p>

<p>So what sorts of things do you have to provide in your open-source project's infrastructure,
and why?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Access to the code and to whatever precompiled versions you can provide.</strong><br />
The code is of course required for this to be open source.  Many groups stop right there,
presuming that people interested in open source will be able to compile their own software
anyway.  In my own opinion, however, the community should be easy to join, and that means
not having to fight with the compiler to start.  (The reason for source-only distribution,
of course, is that most open source is Unixware, and portability between Unix versions is
fraught with extreme peril.  It's easier not to mess with executable distributions.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your community needs to be able to communicate.</strong><br />
  This need is fulfilled by a number of different mechanisms: traditionally, mailing lists have
  been used for communication about open projects, but any such system will do.  So you can
  set up a mailing list, a Usenet newsgroup, or a Web-based bulletin board, but you have to
  provide an easy means of communication or you have no community and no open source project.
  If you set up one, be prepared for complaints that you're not using the others.  In fact,
  no matter what you do in open source, be prepared for complaints that you're leaving somebody
  out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fixes and patches need to be easy to provide.</strong><br />
  The most popular solution to this problem is CVS.  CVS is a version-control system that is
  easily used in a decentralized environment, and of course it's open-source.  The other
  popular solution is "mail me any patches and I'll incorporate them."  The danger of having
  a single lead, of course, is that should the lead lose interest it may be difficult to keep
  the community together.
  [<em>Note 2020-11-28 as I move to yet another publishing system: Github is of course the most popular solution today.</em>]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation should be profuse and easy to find.</strong><br />
  This should be obvious.  However, the problem with open source in general is that the
  people writing it are brilliant and focussed on solving the immediate problem (or developing
  the immediate cool feature.)  So documentation, while always present, is sometimes nearly as
  opaque as the code itself, and very often it's much simpler just to read the code.  (On the
  other hand, sometimes somebody was motivated to write some good documentation, and then it's
  brilliant.)  Documentation is commonly included with the code in the form of man pages or HTML.  And
  in almost all cases I know, documentation is also linked directly from the project's home page.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bug reporting should be easy</strong><br />
  This is another case where many projects aren't too well organized.  Bugs are generally
  identified using the mailing list, and lead developers often maintain a to-do list in the form of
  a text file.  The TODO file is sort of an informal standard, and contains known bugs and
  suggested enhancements for the product.  <i>Note</i>: most bugs are fixed as soon as they're
  found, so the list of known bugs is very often quite short and contains bugs that are difficult
  to encounter.  It really isn't as horrible as it sounds -- and not a tenth as horrible as
  the list of known bugs you can sometimes find with closed software.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>[<i>And this model's still good, if you ask me in 2008.</i>]</p>

<p>That's what I have to say about open source right now.  I'm embroiled in leading a real
live open-source project even as we speak, but so far that is just in its early coding stages.  There is a small
discussion community in place and I get the occasional interested email, but as no-one is yet using the product, most of the
grist for the open source mill is yet to come.  I'll try to keep this page updated with my experiences.
[<i>But of course, I didn't.</i>]</p>

<p><em>Note 2008-06-23</em>:</p>

<p>I originally wrote this during initial development of the wftk toolkit, which (yeah) turned out to be too damned
complicated to finish as originally conceived.  And then Life Happened, as I've documented volubly elsewhere.  My kid
got sick, my country went batshit insane, my business failed, and all sorts of stuff happened, and I frankly forgot I wrote
this at all.  Today, however, I see 23 links in from StumbleUpon.  Isn't that weird?  So, what the heck.  I Wiki-ized the page
and updated it, for what that's worth.  I think that one review misses the point of this page, actually -- this is meant to
give the recovering corporate programmer some idea of how fricking <em>different</em> open source really is.  And if you think
the gift economy is compatible with commercialization, well, all I can say is good luck to you on your journey through life.</p>

<p><em>Note 2020-11-29</em>:</p>

<p>It's kind of sweet how 2008 me thought America was insane <em>then</em>.</p>
