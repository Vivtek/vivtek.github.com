<h2>Group shot in 1999</h2>
<hr>
<p>
OK, yeah, yeah, eight months just to scan and upload a lousy photograph -- well I don't see
anybody else doing it!  Ha.  Let me share with you the mindblowing experience that was the
15-year reunion.  Remember that I had seen, well, not a single soul of any of you for 15
years.  I was one of the first there.  Brenda hadn't changed, so at least I knew I was at
the right party.  As people came in the door, with spouse, I kid you not, in almost every
case I wasn't sure which of these two people I'd gone to school with.  It was one of the
strangest experiences I have ever had.
<p>
Then, oddly, after talking to each one for a time, it was totally natural who was who.  So
anyway, I got the idea that for those of you who <i>didn't</i> attend the reunion, it would
be really cool to give you the same experience.  Sort of.  So here is the picture.  Below
the picture is a form.  Fill in as many names as you can and submit the form, and we can
all laugh about who is the hardest to recognize.  After you submit the form you'll get a
version of the page with names, or you can chicken out and <i>not</i> submit the form and
just follow the link.  But since I read my access logs, I'll figure out who you are, and
then I'll hound you mercilessly for being a big chicken.
<p>
Now, in 2004, I expect to see more locals there!  Those of you still living within ten
miles of Hagerstown have <i>no excuse whatsoever</i> for not coming to reunions!  Next time
I'm going to get a big bus and drive around to your houses and <i>force</i> you to come,
because we out-of-towners (like Mike Hoskins, who actually came from Houston for the reunion)
would really kind of like to see all of <i>you</i>, too.  At least I would, can't speak for
all of them.
<p>
With no further fanfare, here's the picture.
