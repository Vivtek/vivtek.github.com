<hr>
I'll open up with a warning: most of the presentation of this code is influenced in the back
of my mind by my desire to turn this into a comparison of C and Perl coding styles.  I've been
writing C code for a very long time, and only recently have I started doing Perl.  I like both.
I have applications for markup tokenization in both.  I want QDMT in both.  But I have a 
pressing need for QDMT in C only at the moment.  Oh well.  But in the following I'll talk a 
lot about "C-like" style, which would be really kind of odd in a presentation of C code unless
the author were explicitly comparing language coding styles, which (hereafter) I will
not.
<p>
So anyway, the interface for QDMT is pretty standard plain C.  (I'm not getting into any
C++ ruminations here, just the basic facts.)  To start things up, you create a tokenizer, which
is a <code>QDMT_TOKENIZER</code> structure.  The tokenizer is then called repeatedly and
delivers tokens, which are <code>QDMT_TOK</code> structures.  Very straightforward.
<p>
Since I don't want to duplicate everything in <code>malloc</code>'d buffers, the tokens themselves
will contain extents, not buffers.  An <i>extent</i>, at least the way I'm defining it, consists
of a pointer to the data (i.e. into a buffer) and the length of the data.  So I can define a
single buffer and create all the extents I want on it.
<p>
I'll be requiring some standard libraries:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;malloc.h>
#include &lt;string.h>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The basic datastructures we'll be working with are as follows:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>typedef struct _qdmt_tokenizer QDMT_TOKENIZER;
typedef struct _qdmt_token QDMT_TOKEN;
typedef struct _qdmt_attribute QDMT_ATTRIBUTE;
typedef enum   _qdmt_tagtype QDMT_TAGTYPE;
typedef struct _qdmt_extent QDMT_EXTENT;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
And here are the types of token we'll be returning from a tokenizer:
<ul>
<li>QDMT_TAG_PLAIN is plain text, not strictly a tag but certainly a type of token.
<li>QDMT_TAG_OPEN is an open tag: <code>&lt;a ...&gt;</code>.
<li>QDMT_TAG_CLOSE is the corresponding close tag: <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
<li>QDMT_TAG_EMPTY is an XML empty tag: <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>.
<li>QDMT_TAG_COMMENT is a markup comment: <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>.
<li>QDMT_TAG_PI is an XML processing instruction: <code>&lt;? ?&gt;</code>.
<li>QDMT_TAG_DIRECTIVE is an XML directive: <code>&lt;! &gt;</code>.
<li>QDMT_TAG_CDATA, finally, is XML CDATA: <code>&lt;![CDATA[ ... ]]&gt;</code>.
</ul>

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>enum _qdmt_tagtype {
   QDMT_TAG_PLAIN, QDMT_TAG_OPEN, QDMT_TAG_CLOSE, QDMT_TAG_EMPTY,
   QDMT_TAG_COMMENT, QDMT_TAG_PI, QDMT_TAG_DIRECTIVE, QDMT_TAG_CDATA };

</pre></td></tr></table>

A tokenizer may be built on a regular file stream, or on a buffer which we have in memory
somewhere.  Ultimately the filestream version will buffer most of the file in memory anyway.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>struct _qdmt_tokenizer {
   FILE * file;
   char * buf;
};

</pre></td></tr></table>

Attributes are pretty simple.  Since the names and values of attributes are assumed to be
pretty short, I don't mind duplicating them in buffer in exchange for ease of use.  Later
versions might want to make a hash table or something for stashing these guys, but right
now they'll just get <code>malloc</code>'d each time.

Each attribute also has a pointer to the extent which defines it, in case I want to do
something more specific with it.  Unlikely but possible.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>struct _qdmt_attribute {
   char *name;
   char *value;
   QDMT_EXTENT *ref;
};

</pre></td></tr></table>

And as mentioned above, a token contains an extent.  It also contains some attributes, defined
above.  Note that the actual number of attrributes is determined at runtime and so the array
is dimensioned as size 1.
This kind of thing is not unusual in
Windows programming, where I have the vast majority of my C experience; I'm not sure of its
usage under Unix.  But it will work.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>struct _qdmt_token {
   QDMT_EXTENT * full;
   char * name;
   QDMT_TAGTYPE type;
   int num_attributes;
   QDMT_ATTRIBUTE attributes[1];
};

</pre></td></tr></table>

Finally, let's look at the extent structure.  It's probably more complicated than it needs to
be, but I want to have a compact way to get at anything that might interest me about a token.
Extents are assumed to be in a tree, and eventually the extent tree might be used to reflect
more of the element structure of the document.  Not right now, though.  Right now the only
tree structure we'll see is that the reference extents for attributes will refer into the
extent for the parent element.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>struct _qdmt_extent {
   char *text;
   int length;
   int from_row, from_col;
   int to_row, to_col;
   QDMT_EXTENT *parent;
};

</pre></td></tr></table>
