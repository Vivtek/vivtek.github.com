<html><head><title>nav.pl -- Simple navbar CGI script</title></head>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>
This navbar script is yet another result of the <a href=/wftk.html>open-source workflow
toolkit</a> project.  For the user interface, I needed a navbar, I wanted something frames-based,
I cobbled something together, and now I'm going back and documenting what I did.
<p>
This, like many of my recent programming work, is coded in a <a href=/litprog.html>literate
programming style</a>.  That means that the documentation and code are intertwined in an XML
document, which is then processed to create both these web pages and the code files themselves.
The upshot is that the documentation is much more in-synch with the code (because I can only
modify the code by modifying the common source to both), and due to the excellent documentation
<i>during development</i>, the code is much more likely to be correct.  The tool I'm using
for this is my own <a href=/lpml.html>LPML</a>, which is an XML-like markup language processor.

Here's a rundown of what we've got here:

<li> <a href="cgi.html">Main CGI script nav.pl</a>
