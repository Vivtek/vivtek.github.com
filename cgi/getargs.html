<h2>Perl/CGI implementation of RFC1867 file upload</h2>
<hr>
This is an implementation of RFC1867 in a form which makes it a generally useful procedure
for getting form input in a CGI program.  That is, you can call this procedure whether
you're expecting file uploads or not; there's very little overhead involved if no files are
actually provided.  So it makes for convenient site design.
<p></p>
Since this code will execute in a CGI environment, there are two sources of input data.
The QUERY_STRING environment variable may contain &amp;-delimited URL-encoded data, and
there may be input data on stdin as well.  If a normal form is used, then stdin-derived
data is also &amp;-delimited URL-encoded data, but if an RFC1867 file upload form is in
use, then the format is as I describe on my <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/rfc1867.html">RFC1867
page</a>.  This routine doesn't care; it'll take anything it can get, and will even combine
data from both possible sources.
<p></p>
You can get the finished form of the code <a href="_getargs.txt">here</a>.  To use it with
your CGI code, just put it in your use page and do this:
<blockquote><code>use "_getargs.txt";</code></blockquote>
(Or you can rename the file to something else, of course.)
<p></p>
This routine returns input values into a hash, and returns a reference to the hash (often
called a hashref.)  And we use a hashref to pass in information about how to handle uploads,
as well.  So you use the function and the returned data like this:
<blockquote>
<code>
$uploads{base} = "/usr/local/my/directory";<br>
$uploads{file} = "upload_[(field)]";<br>
$uploads{mime}{image/jpeg} = "jpg";<br>
$input = getargs(\%uploads);<br>
$myvalue = $$input{name};
</code>
</blockquote>
(If you haven't seen $$ to retrieve hashref values, then go buy the Camel book right now.)
<p></p>
Here's what the main function looks like.  All the underlined italic phrases are code 
chunks which are elaborated down below.  You can follow the link, or you can just scroll
down the page; this whole file is presented on one page.  Excuse the disclaimer there, but
it kind of has to be there these days.

We've got one helper function which builds a filename from values already encountered in
the form.  Very useful for attaching files to things.

And then we have to return 1 so that <code>use</code> won't get upset.

<br><br>
<a name="collect">
<i>Collect all the URL-encoded input into $input</i><br>
The contents of the QUERY_STRING environment variable are always URL-encoded.  And if we're
not getting our input from an RFC1867 multipart-data form, then stdin also contains
URL-encoded data, so we simply get it line by line and tack it onto <code>$input</code>.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>my $input = $ENV{QUERY_STRING};
if (lc($ENV{CONTENT_TYPE}) eq 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded') {
   $input .= "&amp;" if $input ne '';
   while (<>) {
     chomp;
     $input .= $_;
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br><br>
<a name="process">
<i>Process the URL-encoded input into hash</i><br>
Each chunk of URL-encoded input is split into a name and value, delimited by the '='.
So we split on the '=', then we URL-decode the value and write it into our output hash
keyed by the name.  This has some side effects, notable among which is the fact that a URL
may easily contain two values with the same name (some of my own code uses this sort of trick,
for instance, to represent a list of checkboxes of items to delete from a list.)  If this
happens, the hash will <i>not</i> reflect this -- the last occurrence of a name will be the
one that survives in the hash.
<p></p>
So you've been warned.  For most applications this code will work fine.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>my $i;
my @t;
my %tagset;
foreach $i (split /&amp;/, $input) {
   @t = split /=/, $i, 2;
      
   $t[1] =~ tr/+/ /;
   $t[1]=~ s/%([a-fA-F0-9][a-fA-F0-9])/pack("C", hex($1))/eg;
   $tagset{$t[0]} = $t[1];
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br><br>
<a name="quitnow">
<i>Return the hash right now if we don't have file uploads</i><br>
To check whether there is mulitpart data on stdin, we just check our content type.  If it's
not multipart, we return a reference to our <code>tagset</code> hash.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>return \%tagset if (lc($ENV{CONTENT_TYPE}) !~ m'multipart/form-data;');
</pre></td></tr></table>

If we <i>do</i> have multi-part data, then it's still going to get into the hash, but it will
be considerably more involved to get it.
<br><br>
<a name="rfc1867">
<i>Do the RFC1867 thing</i><br>
So OK, let's get down to business actually reading multipart/form-data input.  First, let's
reserve our variables, so as not to clutter up the namespace.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>my $line;
my $lines;
my $name;
my $type;
my $filename;
my $file = 0;
my $localname;
</pre></td></tr></table>

Where we actually put files, and how we name them, is governed by the <code>uploads</code>
hashref passed in as a parameter to the function.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>my $uploads = shift @_;
</pre></td></tr></table>

The content-type of a multipart/form-data header includes the boundary string.  The boundary
string is a string guaranteed not to appear in the data itself.  So it's safe to separate
fields within the input.  Each field will thus consist of a number of lines on stdin, separated
by the boundary value on its own line.  Let's get the boundary value now.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>my ($junk,$boundary) = split /=/, $ENV{CONTENT_TYPE}, 2;
$boundary =~ s/\n//;
$boundary = "--$boundary";
</pre></td></tr></table>

Now we enter the main loop of the reader.  If the line is a boundary line, then we read the
header immediately following in order to know how to process subsequent lines; otherwise, we
handle the current line appropriately depending on whether we're in the middle of a file, or just
a plain data field.  (If we're in the middle of a file, then the line is decoded and written
to the file we have open while we're reading.)
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>LINE: while (<>) {
      last if ($_ eq "${boundary}--\r\n");
      if ($_ eq "$boundary\r\n") {
         <i>See <a href="getargs.html#boundary">Handle transition to new field</a></i>
      }

      if ($file) {
         # Write the line to the temp file.
         print _GETARGS_TEMP $_;
      } else {
         s/[\r\n]*$//;
         if ($lines > 0) {$tagset{$name} .= "\n"; }
         $tagset{$name} .= $_;
         $lines ++;
      }
   }
   close _GETARGS_TEMP;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br><br>
<a name="boundary">
<i>Handle transition to new field</i><br>
At the beginning of each field, we have several lines of headers, followed by a blank line,
followed by content.  When a boundary comes up, then, we have to interpret the headers
to see what's coming next.  The first header is the Content-Disposition, which gives us
the name of the field, and if it's a file then it also gives us the client-side filename.
<blockquote>
<code>Content-Disposition: form-data; name="myfile"; filename="c:\myfile.txt"</code>
</blockquote>
So the first thing we do at the beginning of a field is to decipher the contents of this
first line of headers.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>$line=<>; # Get first line of headers.
$line =~ s/.*?; //; # Chop off the Content-Disposition part, we don't need it.
($name, $filename) = split /; /, $line, 2;
($junk, $name) = split /"/, $name;
</pre></td></tr></table>

Now we have the field name in <code>$name</code> and the filename (if a file upload) in
<code>$filename</code>.  We do a little housework:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>close _GETARGS_TEMP;
$file = 0;
$lines = 0;
</pre></td></tr></table>

(The <code>_GETARGS_TEMP</code> file handle may be open from the last field -- that's the handle
we use to write file upload data to.)
<p></p>
If the filename is blank, this field is just a plain old field and the <code>$file</code>
flag will thus remain zero.  But if there is a filename, then we have to process it and then
get the next line so as to interpret the content type.
<p></p>
For each upload field, this code will create a "virtual field" in the output hash listing the
details of the upload (like the client-side local filename).  If the field is named myfield,
then the details of the upload will end up in <code>_details_myfield</code>.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>if ($filename ne "") {
   $file = 1;
   ($junk, $filename) = split /"/, $filename;
   $tagset{"_details_$name"} = $filename;
</pre></td></tr></table>
OK, so let's get the next line, which is the Content-Type.  This is the MIME type of the
incoming file.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   $line=<>;
   chomp $line;
   ($junk, $type) = split ": ", $line;
   $type =~ s/\r*//g;
   $tagset{"_details_$name"} .= "|" . $type;
</pre></td></tr></table>

Our next step will be to determine a filename in which to store the incoming file data.
First, the extension.  If you have extensions preset in the <code>$uploads</code> hashref,
then we'll use that.  (To do this, when building your hashref, do something like the following.)
<blockquote>
<code>
my %uploads;<br>
$uploads{mime}{image/jpeg} = "jpg";<br>
$input = getargs(\%uploads);
</code>
</blockquote>
The reason this is important is that many uploads will be coming from Windows machines, where
extensions may well be in capital letters.  If you're running on Unix, and using this for
upload of files to be served from a website, then the extension ".JPG" probably won't be
served with the proper mimetype of "image/jpeg", simply because the extension ".jpg" is the
only one registered.  Add that to the fact that JPEG files are often stored with a four-character
extensions, and chaos ensues.
<p></p>
So let's check <code>$uploads</code> for an extension for the current MIME type.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   $ext = $$uploads{mime}{$type};
   if ($ext eq '') {
      $ext = $filename;
      $ext =~ s/^.*\.//;
   }
</pre></td></tr></table>
And now let's call <code>getargs_makefilename</code> to format us a filename based on fields
already read.  (See below for an explanation of this function.)
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   $tagset{$name} = getargs_makefilename ($$uploads{file}, \%tagset, $name);
   if ($ext ne '') { $tagset{$name} .= ".$ext"; }
</pre></td></tr></table>

Then, using the <code>$uploads</code> parameter again to determine the base directory for the
file, build a filename and open the file in <code>_GETARGS_TEMP</code>.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>   $localname = "$$uploads{base}/$tagset{$name}";
   if ($localname ne '') {
      if (open _GETARGS_TEMP, ">$localname") {
         $tagset{"_details_$name"} .= "|" . $localname;
      }
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
Finally, toss any remaining header lines (whether this is an upload field or not.)  This is
probably a bad idea, but so far it seems to be working.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>while ($line=<>) { next LINE if $line == "\n"; }
</pre></td></tr></table>

And that was it.  That's one way of parsing RFC1867 file uploads, and you could do
substantially the same thing in any language (although those Perl regexps sure make things
easy.)
<br><br>
<a name="makefilename">
<i>Helper function to build filename</i><br>
The only piece still missing is that <code>getargs_makefilename</code> function used above.
It takes a name specification string, the hash currently being read as a hashref, and the
name of the field actually being worked on.
<p></p>
It scans the namespec for things in square brackets, and replaces them with the corresponding
value from the hashref.   It has one special value: any occurrence of [(field)] will be
replaced with the field name of the file being uploaded.  This allows multiple files to be
uploaded on a single form.
<p></p>
So if I have a form with a username field, say, and two upload fields, call them "file1" and
"file2", then I could specify a namespec like "<code>[username]_[(field)]</code>".  If my
username is joe, then the first file will end up in a file named <code>joe_file1</code> (plus
the MIME-specified extension) and the second in <code>joe_file2</code>.  Clear?  I thought so.
<p></p>
Just to be on the safe side, we'll also remove "dangerous" characters from the filename.
Dangerous characters are basically any kind of punctuation.  And I like to replace spaces with
underscores as well, just to make coding easier elsewhere.  But hey -- if it doesn't work for
you, by all means take that part out.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>sub getargs_makefilename {
   my $spec = shift(@_);
   my $object = shift(@_);
   my $field = shift(@_);

   while ($spec =~ /\[(.*?)\]/) {
      $tag = $1;
      if ($tag eq '(field)') {
         $val = $field;
      } else {
         $val = $$object{$tag};
      }
      $val =~ tr/ /_/;
      $val =~ s/[&amp;!"'*;]//g;
      $tag =~ s/\(/\\(/g;
      $tag =~ s/\)/\\)/g;
      $spec =~ s/\[$tag\]/$val/g;
   }

   return $spec;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
This kind of thing is just so easy in Perl.  I love Perl.

<a name="conclusion">
<i>Conclusion</i><br>
So all in all, RFC1867 may not be for the faint-hearted, because there is a lot to keep track
of in comparison to plain text values -- but it's not brain surgery, either.  I use the above
code daily for a number of my customers' needs, and you can, too.  If you do find it useful,
tell me -- I'd like to know what's good and what's bad about this presentation.  And if you
make any changes, I'd love to know what and why.
