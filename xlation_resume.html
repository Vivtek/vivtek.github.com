<B>Overview</B><P>
This is the translation version of my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and as such, it contains
only brief reference to the extensive technical experience which I consider
an integral part of my translation skills.  For more detail, see
<a href="http://www.vivtek.com/michael_resume.html">my technical r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.
Although I was certified as a technical translator in 1988, I have been translating on what
I consider a professional basis since 2001, about <b>12 years</b> now.
<p>
Since 2006, I've translated 1 to 1.25 million words per year.  A typical month is 80,000 to 120,000 words.

details of my technical experience.<br><br>

As Vivtek, I provide consulting and implementation for online and offline
software development, primarily in the area of online databases.  I write
technical articles, several of which have been published (for pay) on IBM's
developerWorks site.  These are pretty good online samples of my writing
skills, so you might want to look at a couple of the more recent ones:
