CONDITIONS OF USE
</U><br>
(Or, Vivtek's stab at legalese.  Like it?)</center>
<P>
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.  By using this site, you
signify your assent to these terms of use.  If you do not agree to these terms of use, please
do not use the site.
</B>
<P>
<BR>
<B>RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF MATERIALS.</B>
<P>
This site (http://www.vivtek.com, referred to as "the site" or "this site" herein) is owned and operated
by Vivtek (referred to as "we," "us" or "our" herein).
<P>
No material from the site may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, 
transmitted, or distributed in any way, UNLESS you keep intact all copyright and other 
proprietary notices and provide a link or direction back to http://www.vivtek.com, preferably
in the form of a link to the originating page.
Modification of any such materials without our explicit written permission
is a violation of our copyright and other proprietary rights.  Automatic transformation of any
such materials is permitted, but any such derivative materials are considered equivalent to the
original form of the materials and are to be governed by the same rules as material 
downloaded directly.
<P>
In the event you purchase or download software from the site, said software, including any files, 
images, or data accompanying the software (collectively, the "Software") are licensed to you by
us.  Any files, images, or data generated by the software while you use it are, of course, yours.
We do not transfer title to the Software to you.  You own the medium on which the Software is
recorded, but we retain full and complete title to the Software, and all intellectual property
rights therein.  You may reduce the Software to other forms, including human-readable or
disassembled forms (you will anyway if you want to), but all such derivative forms are
to be considered equivalent to the Software under this agreement, just as any other automatic
transformation of materials we own.
<P><BR>


<B>TERMINATION.</B>
<P>
This agreement is effective until terminated by either party.  You may terminate this 
agreement at any time by destroying all materials obtained from any and all of our sites 
and all related documentation and all copies and installations thereof, whether made under 
the terms of this agreement or otherwise.  This agreement will terminate immediately 
without notice from us if, in our sole discretion, you fail to comply with any term or 
provision of this agreement.  Upon termination, you must destroy all materials obtained 
from this site and any and all of our other sites and all copies thereof, whether made under 
the terms of this agreement or otherwise. 
<P><BR>

<B>DISCLAIMER.
<P>
THE MATERIALS IN THIS SITE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  TO THE 
FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WE 
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE 
FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE MATERIALS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED 
OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THIS 
SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES 
OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.  WE DO NOT WARRANT OR MAKE 
ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE 
USE OF THE MATERIALS IN THIS SITE IN TERMS OF THEIR 
CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.  YOU (AND 
NOT WE) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE 
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY 
NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<P><BR>

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  </b>
<P>
Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall we be 
liable for any special or consequential damages that result from the use of, or the 
inability to use, the materials in this site, even if we or our authorized 
representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  Applicable law 
may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or 
consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  
In no event shall our total liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes of 
action (whether in contract, tort (including, but not limited to,  negligence) or 
otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for accessing this site.
<P><BR>

<b>
REDISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS
</b><p>
In some cases, you may be granted the right to re-sell the Software as long as you do so 
according
to the published Vivtek Distribution Agreement (referred to as "Distribution Agreement" herein) in
force at the time of the resale, NOT that in force at the time of your purchase of the Software.
We retain the right to change the Distribution Agreement at any time with no notice, and the
current Distribution Agreement may proclude redistribution.  (This sounds a little weird but it
covers us in case the whole redistribution thing doesn't work out.)
<p><br>

<b>
OTHER. 
</b>
<P>
This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
State of Indiana, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.  If any 
provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then 
that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the 
validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  This is the entire agreement 
between the parties relating to the subject matter herein and shall not be modified except 
in writing, signed by both parties.
<P>
