<p>Analog is an excellent basic log analysis tool written and maintained by Stephen Turner.
It's free and open source, and there are lots and lots of helper applications,
knowledgeable people, and so forth.  A classic <a href=/open_source.html>open source</a> success story -- and it's the most used access log analysis tool in
the world.  Why aren't you using it?</p>

<p>The current version of Analog as of this writing is 4.16.  For an example output, you can see <a href=/cur_stats4.html>my current
stats</a> in the format I like them best.  Analog can do 32 different reports, and each is quite customizable.  There are
plenty of things you <i>can't</i> do in Analog, but boy, the things it does, it does well.  And quickly.</p>

<p>Even if you have log-like files which aren't standard, you can quite easily describe their format for Analog, and it will
analyze them handily.  This is convenient for analysis of traffic for any arbitrary Internet daemon.</p>

<p>Since I've been working with Analog for about two years now in the context of quite a few sites, I feel pretty good about
offering commercial Analog support. <em>[Or did, in 2001.]</em></p>

<li><p><strong><a href=/analog/solaris.html>Solaris precompiled executables</a></strong> (of historical interest only)<br>
Getting Analog to compile is pretty easy, but there are a couple of gotchas I went through on
Solaris a million years ago. OK, about twenty. Here's a nicely packaged version of my own 4.16 executable --
I compiled with gcc on Solaris 2.5.1, but the executable works fine on at least Solaris 2.6.</p></li>
