As noted elsewhere, Vivtek is at the present time primarily a service company.  We're working to
diversify.  Here are some of the hugely ridiculously major projects we dream about.  If even one
of these is ever implemented, you'll be reading about us in Wired.  At the moment, however, we
are content to be one of the leading players in the vaporware industry.

</td></td>
<tr><td>
Ah, literate programming.  This is something we dream about a lot.  We have finally completed
<a href=/litprog.html>a topic page on literate programming</a>, so now our way is clear to
implement one of these tools.  Ha!  We envision two basic
tools for literate programming: the <a href=/vvlp.html>VVLP (Vivtek Literate Programmer)</a>
and the <a href=/dlp.html>DLP (Distributed Literate Programmer)</a>.
<p>
The VVLP is a Windows-based, OLE-compliant literate programming tool.  By literate programming, we
are envisioning something a little more ambitious (this is the vaporware page, after all)
than Knuth's original concept.  We want full pattern-oriented template-based processing, along
with a lot of stuff which will make it easy to write custom, specialized code generators which
work with arbitrary data to write programs.  Cool, huh?  Well, don't hold your breath.
<p>
At any rate, OLE compliance means that you'll be able to use Word for your typesetting and
documentation and then edit code right in the documentation using a real code editor.  And have
access to all the other goodies from the same editor, too.
<p>
So what's DLP?  DLP focusses more on the group effort and will very likely interface with VVLP
in some way.  This is vague because, well, it's vaporware.  DLP will provide tools for groups
working together (or not very together) to do things in a literate way.  It's aimed at open
software kinds of groups.
<p>
The DLP will also provide a Web interface to allow interactive browsing and annotation of projects,
including a bulletin-board format for group interaction, change request tracking, and so forth.  It'll
allow you to update code by mailing it to an autoresponder.
It's gonna be good.  As soon as it makes that crucial transition from vaporware to software,
that is.

<A name="ontology">
<center><br><font face=arial size=+1>ONTOLOGY TOOLS AND ONTOLOGIES</font></center>
</td></td>
<tr><td>
We've been captivated of late with ontologies or knowledge tools.  An ontology is a set of logical
statements which define (or at least interrelate) concepts in a given area.  It works with a
lexicon to actually connect those concepts to words and phrases.  So there are two things we want
to do.  First, we'd like to come up with an ontological extension to the normal database paradigm.
And then we'd like to formalize our topic pages into an industry ontology.  It seems to us that
such an ontology would not only be a useful way to navigate a website, but also could lead to
formal ways to specify program components, even for the technically naive.  And <i>that</i> would
be a neat service.
<p>
Anyway, we even have some formal vaporware in this area: the <a href=/the-survey.html>Vivtek
Industry Survey</a>.  Want to see it?  Send mail or money, that's the best.
