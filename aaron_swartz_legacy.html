<div class="title">Aaron Swartz's legacy</div>
</p><p>
Aaron Swartz committed suicide last night.
</p><p>
It's really only in the past year or so that I had grown aware
of him at all; one hears a lot of names over the course of following
the industry and the Internet scene, and I'd naturally heard of him.
But it was only recently that I had come
to realize that I kept hearing about him in
matters that were of particular interest to <i>me</i>,
the most significant
being, of course, the JSTOR story (Harvard Law has a great
write-up of that whole thing
<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/sj/2011/07/24/aaron-swartz-v-united-states/">at their blog</a>.)
</p><p>
Today, though, his untimely death at only 26 having brought forth
a flurry of writing about him, I've read quite a lot about him,
and some of his own writing.
Cory Doctorow writes, "I think he could have revolutionized American
(and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so."
<a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html">That whole article</a>
is well worth a read, by the way.
</p><p>
Cory quotes some of Aaron's off-the-cuff thoughts about an electioneering
system that makes sense, one that is inherently data-driven and democratic
because it actively attempts to find out the people want, and <i>do that</i>.
Honestly,
it scares me a little because it could be an utter big-data juggernaut
and I frankly wonder what that might bring, but ... damn.  Moth, meet flame.
</p><p>
I kept reading.  Swartz was exactly 20 years younger than I - we shared
a birthday.  We're both from the middle of the country (he from Chicago,
I from rural Indiana), and he grew up with an Internet and I didn't.
I look at his accomplishments and I am in awe - and yet I get an
idea of what killed him. It's tempting to say it was the prospect of
prison for a "crime" that hurt no-one and whose supposed victims
didn't even want to press charges, and I suspect that's not too far wrong.
</p><p>
But his politics were awfully damn close to mine, and I think he felt
the same sense of a world gone hell-in-a-handbasket wrong, and the same
vision of how things <i>could</i> be if all the corruption and
special interests were swept away.  The fact that the government actively
works to hinder that vision is distressing.  (Lawrence Lessig has some
<a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">good thoughts on this aspect</a>.)
Swartz spent a significant
part of his short life trying to steer that train, and I think it was
just too much.
</p><p>
I didn't know him.  But I sure wish I had.  This is a guy who talked
his way onto a W3C standards committee at the age of 14, who helped
build Reddit through the Y Combinator phase, helped convert it to
Python and had <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit">cogent thoughts</a>
about that process.  He was instrumental in defeating SOPA/PIPA last
year, founding <a href="http://demandprogress.org/">DemandProgress</a> to do that.
He went on to found the
<a href="http://boldprogressives.org/">Progressive Change Campaign Committee</a>, again
an initiative I'd heard about without correlating it with him.
He worked at <a href="http://www.avaaz.org/en/">Avaaz</a>, a non-profit working to
provide tools to support democracy around the world, and he just kept
writing more <a href="http://act.watchdog.net/">tools to help people organize</a>
his entire life.  He even spent a lot of his Reddit money buying case law
records (data that is supposed to be in the public domain, but is not
provided free of charge by the government) and
<a href="http://theinfo.org/">putting them online</a>.  And yes, he downloaded a
significant amount of the world's research history from a laptop in a closet
at MIT - data that never saw the light of day due to legal threats.
</p><p>
His basic starting point seems to have been that he was nothing special,
that anybody could do what he did using a simple five-step process he
outlines in his article
<a href="https://aaronsw.jottit.com/howtoget">How to Get a Job Like Mine</a>:
1. Learn, 2. Try, 3. Gab, 4. Build, 5. Freedom.  And you know what?
He's right.  He's so right.  There's so much work to be done.
</p><p>
That's a powerful legacy. I'm damn well going to try to live up to it.
