<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>This website (everything rooted at http://www.vivtek.com/queenbeewatch)
is provided as a service (the Service) to the Internet community,
free of charge.  Vivtek assumes no responsibility at all for any damages
whatsoever related to the use of the Service.
</li>
<li>Vivtek is a sole proprietorship registered in Monroe County, Indiana.
My actual name is Michael Roberts, and you can reach me by email at
<a href="mailto:michael@vivtek.com">michael@vivtek.com</a>.  Be warned: I don't
suffer fools gladly.  Think twice and read the rest of these Terms of Service
before presuming on my time.
</li>
<li>
Any and all communications to me related to this Service shall be considered
to be made in public.  If you are a public figure featured on this site,
please consider that whatever you have to say to me will be taken as addressed
to America.  As such, I'll post it immediately.
</li>
<li>The Service has a data storage part which registered users may use
to store publically available information relating to public figures.
If you or your organization find material in the database which you find
detrimental and which <i>you can demonstrate is factually untrue</i>, Vivtek
will make reasonable efforts to correct the information.  If, on the other
hand, the information you find detrimental consists only of statements you
have made in the public press or other public venues, then I suggest you
consider a public retraction, which will be published on this site along with
the original information.
</li>
<li>The Service's data storage part may also contain contact information
for public figures and organizations.  If you or organization objects to this
republication of this information, then I suggest you reconsider your
desire to be seen as a public figure.
</li>
<li>
The Service also has a messaging part which can be used by registered users
to send email messages to public figures relating to specific tracked
incidents.  This part is subject to the following rules:
<ul>
<li>The messages must be civil and reasonable in tone, according to <i>my</i>
judgment and no other.  I own this Service and I say how it's used.  If you
want to send uncivil messages, use your own email server, not mine.</li>
<li>All messages are tracked and verified.  If you want privacy, again, feel
free to use your own email server.</li>
<li>Messages must be relevant to specific incidents recorded in the database.
</li>
<li>No more than one message per day may be sent by any user to any public
figure.  We are not in the business of mail bombing; we are in the business
of convincing people that America deserves more mature public discourse.</li>
</ul>
Any user found <i>in my sole opinion</i> to be in violation of these Terms
of Service will be summarily terminated and further trusted use of the Service
will be disallowed by any technical means at my disposal.  If the infractions
are severe enough, your ISP <i>will</i> be notified of any breach of
<i>their</i> Terms of Service.  You've been warned.  Keep it mature, or else.
</li>
<li>These Terms of Service may be changed or extended at any time at my
sole discretion (that means: as I discover some other thing that people can
do to take advantage of my generosity.)  The changed or extended Terms will
then apply to all existing users -- no grandfathering in to more lenient Terms.
</li>
<li>
Have a nice day!
</li>
</ol>
