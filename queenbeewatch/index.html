The idea of this site is a simple one: our American media is out of control.
Instead of fulfilling the journalistic function anticipated by the Founding
Fathers, the talking heads of the punditocracy instead blather on about
junior-high nuances like what politicians are wearing, or their hair,
or describe political debates in terms of catfights in the school halls.
</p>

<p>
It's pathetic.
</p>

<p>But the situation is more than the embarrassment on the world stage
that it would first appear.  In fact, it is a disease which strikes at
the heart of American democracy.  If the only people you ever hear are
always telling you that it's the <i>personalities</i> that matter in politics,
and never the actual <i>issues</i>, how can you ever act to make your
world a better place?  How can you decide if you never see the facts --
worse, how can you decide if you're told <i>there are no facts to see</i>?
</p>

<p>
So it's not just pathetic.  It's poison.
</p>

<p>
This site is a rough attempt to track the abuse, and provides tools for
you to do something about it.  Following a post by
<a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2006_11_01_digbysblog_archive.html#116389524810541064">Digby</a>, where he says, "We will do it openly and we will do
it politely....  But we will let them know that they have been caught in
the act," and also the post by <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2006/11/kewl-kidz-and-queen-bees.html">Sara Robinson at Orcinus</a> which prompted Digby's
post, I thought it might be helpful to be able to track this type of action.
</p>

<p>
The result is this humble little database site, which you might think of as
QueenBeeWatch, or MediaBullyWatch, or something like that.  Here are the
ground rules:
<ul>
<li>
The system allows three types of user: anonymous, registered, and empowered.
</li>
<li>
A registered user can propose, and an empowered user can approve, the addition
of a <i>culprit</i> or an <i>incident</i> to the database.  The culprit may
also be associated with one or more <i>organizations</i> (generally at least
the culprit's employer.)
</li>
<li>
Once an incident has been entered, any registered user can use it to send
email to the culprit and/or the culprit's organization(s) regarding one or
more specific incidents.  There are predefined templates which can be used
for this purpose, which may be general, or specific to the incident.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="tos.html">Terms of Service of this site</a> state that <i>every</i> email sent must be
civil and relevant to a specific incident (or incidents).  If you want to
express your outrage in a non-civil manner, please feel free to send email
using your own email systems.  (See the <a href="tos.html">Terms of Service</a>
for more detailed explanation.)
</li>
<li>
All email sent using the site is tracked.  All responses by culprits or 
organizations is tracked and published on the site.  (If they want privacy,
they are free to leave the public sphere.  Until then, every word they utter
to me is uttered to America.)
</li>
</ul>
That's the lowdown.  Let's make America safe for democracy again, shall we?
