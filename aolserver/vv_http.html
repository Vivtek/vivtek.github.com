Our HTTP client is a replacement for ns_httpget and some of the ancillary
functions like ns_urlencode.  It is a complete HTTP client with some
really nice features, and we were working on more before we found cURL, which
is already written and does a lot more.  (Now the intention is to make cURL
into a Tcl extension.)
<p>
To see a simple example of use of vv_http, take a look at the <a href="/dumbproxy.html">dumb
proxy</a>, which is a cute little tool.
<p>
If you want the vv_http code, email us, because we still (still!) haven't finished our
freebie download system.

<tr><td>
Our HTTP client is a far more capable HTTP client than <code>ns_httpget</code> and <code>ns_httpopen</code>.
(At least we think so.)  Eventually it'll be even better.
<p>
<strong>Features:</strong><ul>
<li>GET, POST, and HEAD supported.
<li>Complete access to headers of request and response.
<li>Exposes parser functionality so that you can build and parse your
own HTTP requests and responses.
<li>User authorization.
</ul><br>
Features we'd like to add:<ul>
<li>Proxy support.
<li>https support.
<li>Support for protocols other than HTTP (like FTP, for instance.)
</ul>
<p>
<strong>History:</strong>
<table>
<tr><td bgcolor=#80ffff>07/06/98</td><td>Created in embryonic form for inclusion in the <a href=/aolserver/cybercash.html>CyberCash integration module for AOLserver</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor=#80ffff>09/14/98</td><td>Finished up enough for the CyberCash integration module.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor=#80ffff>09/15/98</td><td>Introduced vv_urlencode and vv_urldecode.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor=#80ffff>04/24/99</td><td>Introduced vv_http_textget.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor=#80ffff>08/31/99</td><td>Introduced vv_base64_[en|de]code, and user authorization (basic schema).</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<strong>Functions</strong>
Besides the HTTP client, this file defines some helper functions that are useful in isolation, and
also defines a really cheap text client which serves as a very simple example of how to use the
HTTP client.  For another example, you can see the <a href=/dumbproxy>Vivtek dumb proxy</a>, which is
built on this HTTP client.
<table>
<tr><td>vv_http</td><td>The HTTP client itself.  Documented more fully below.</td></tr>
<tr><td>vv_urlencode</td><td>Replaces ns_urlencode.  Encodes a URL the way everybody else does it (so for instance a space is a + and not a %20).</td></tr>
<tr><td>vv_urldecode</td><td>Decodes the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>vv_parsequery</td><td>Parses a query string into an ns_set.  Handy little function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>vv_textget</td><td>Given a URL, returns the textualized content of the URL.  Useful for text-based quickie apps.  Uses vv_html2text.</td></tr>
<tr><td>vv_html2text</td><td>Extracts text from HTML.  Kind of.  It's very crude but usually useful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>vv_base64encode</td><td>Base64-encodes a string.  And you thought this couldn't be done in Tcl!</td></tr>
<tr><td>vv_base64decode</td><td>Base64-decodes a string.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<strong>More information about vv_http itself:</strong>
In this implementation, the HTTP request and its response are stored in
the same object.  The object is stored in an ns_set, which is really a
great data structure, I can't get enough of it.
<p>
<strong>Structure of an HTTP request:</strong><ul>
<li>Protocol, host, and port.  E.g. http://www.vivtek.com:80
<li>URL.                       E.g. /product/AAHT0
<li>HTTP method.               E.g. GET
<li>Query form, with possible repetitions.
<li>Header values.
</ul><p>
<strong>Structure of an HTTP response:</strong><ul>
<li>Reference to the request that prompted it.
<li>Header values returned from the server.
<li>Mime type of returned data.  (Parsed from header.)
<li>Content length.
<li>Content.
<li>Response time, easy and cheap to calculate and nice to have sometimes.
</ul>
<p>
Later this package or a derivative of this package should support smarter
handling of returned HTML (i.e. at least some rudimentary parsing.)
Right now, of course, you have ns_hrefs to get a list of links, at least.
But it would be nice to get applets, images, and especially parse out
forms.
<p>
In the HTTP request object, then, we have the following ns_set keys:<br>
Request keys:
<table>
<tr><td>protocol<br>host</td><td>You can set these independently or simply write them with
host or URL, e.g. http://www.vivtek.com:80/product/AAHT0</td></tr>
<tr><td>port<br>url</td><td>will correctly populate protocol, host, port, and URL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>query</td><td>a "virtual" field which translates back and forth between
the form.* fields and URL-encoded form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>method</td><td>GET or POST.  (Default is GET.)  You can write anything you
want here, as long as the target server understands it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>version</td><td>HTTP/1.0 by default; you can change it if you want.</td></tr>
<tr><td>form.*</td><td>all the values in the form to be queried.  Again, if this
request is a GET, you can include the form info in the URL
and these key/value pairs will be written.</td></tr>
<tr><td>client.*</td><td>all the header values in the request.  Some will be set for
you by default; you can obviously examine these and change them.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A note on protocol: for now, only http: is supported.  Sorry.  Talk to
our buds at the Defense Department about export restrictions on
cryptography if you want https:, but for others just wait a while and
we'll get around to them.
<p>
<strong>Response keys:</strong>
<table>
<tr><td>server.*</td><td>all the header values returned by the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>type</td><td>MIME type of the content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>retver</td><td>Returned version of the response.  Generally identical to version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>status</td><td>Returned status code.  Usually 200.</td></tr>
<tr><td>stattext</td><td>Text of return status message.  Just in case it's interesting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>length</td><td>Content length.</td></tr>
<tr><td>content</td><td>The content returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>time</td><td>Response time of the transaction.</td></tr>
</table>

<strong>Finally, one status key:</strong>
<table>
<tr><td>state</td><td>two values are permitted: "ready" and "complete",
corresponding to whether the request has been sent or not.
A future version of this package should implement a threaded
model, in which a further state "processing" would be valid.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<strong>Commands on HTTP request objects:</strong>
<table>
<tr><td>make</td><td>creates a new request with certain defaults set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>set</td><td>sets any of the above-named values with some special processing,
for instance for URLs and hosts and stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>setform, setclient, setserver</td><td>shorthand for setting form/header values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>setauth</td><td>given userid and password, sets the user authorization line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>get</td><td>gets any named value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>getform, getclient, getserver</td><td>shorthand for getting form/hdr values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>showreq, showresp</td><td>return text values corresponding to the actual
text sent over the network by client and server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>parsereq, parseresp</td><td>parse said text values into the object.</td></tr>
<tr><td>request</td><td>actually executes a request against a server.  (!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>post</td><td>executes the request but doesn't wait for a reply.  Useful when
posting info to a CGI which does something more important than
the reply you get.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that showreq and parsereq together provide a useful way of saving
requests for later repeated execution.  Parseresp is used internally to
interpret the server's response and can be useful for other purposes, too.
