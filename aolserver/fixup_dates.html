For two years I've hated this stupid bug.  The site in question has about 10,000 hits per week (excluding all graphics)
and every few weeks AOLserver (v2.1 on Solaris) glitches the access log, transposing a couple of digits in the date,
or leaving a couple of bytes out, or simply incrementing the year by 100 or so.  It's weird.
<p>
So I wouldn't care <i>that</i> much, except for two things.  First, the first-pass log analysis is done by Analog, which is
a darned good program.  In the case where one year is a hundred years later, though, Analog gives me a bar chart of the
entire hundred years of traffic.  Most of it's pretty empty, but the resulting Analog report, instead of the accustomed
couple hundred K, comes out to several megabytes of download.  Not good.
<p>
But in the last year or so, we've need much more detailed analysis of site usage (the site is <a href=/linkout/www.techspex.com>Techspex</a>
if you're interested; it's a largish online database).  So we've been postprocessing the logs and loading large chunks of them
into the database and doing lots of really involved queries on them.  And to do that, I postprocess the logs into a tab-delimited
format for mass insertion via micopy (yeah, still on Illustra).  And micopy croaks on those bad dates, some of them, meaning
that the reports don't run automatically and I have to go change the file by hand and run them manually.
<p>
So I finally broke down and wrote a script to fix the logs.  And here it is.  You can also <a href=fixup_dates.txt>get a
plaintext version here</a> for easier download if you want to use it.  Knock yourself out.  Tell me if you change it.
