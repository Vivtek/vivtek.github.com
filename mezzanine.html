Saros Mezzanine, acquired by
FileNet, is a document management system.  Document management is a loose term which describes
any system which replaces a filesystem with more organized storage of large, relatively
unstructured data structures.  
<p>
Mezzanine consists of an API on the client implemented in a set of DLLs, and a
server portion which stores documents in a set of managed directories,
maintaining data about the documents (<i>metadata</i>) in an SQL database.
<p>
Mezzanine is thus application-, network-, and database-independent.  The server
runs on Windows NT or on any of several flavors of Unix, and three databases
are supported: Sybase or Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle.
<p>
FileNET's new document management direction is called Panagon or Panagon IDM (Integrated
Document Management.)  Up until version 5.0 of DS (Document Services),
Panagon relied on Mezzanine as its server engine, and the Panagon objects utilize the
old Mezzanine API for communication with the server.  As of version 5.0, however, the
old API is gone.
<p>
That said, there is still a large installed base of Mezzanine users.  Most of them access
Mezzanine through Saros's front-end application SDM (Saros Document Manager), but many have
developed custom front-end applications or integrated the front end with other software.
Mezzanine's API makes this possible in an extremely flexible way, although the API has a truly
intimidating learning curve.  (This was one of the primary motivations for FileNET to completely
rewrite the API into a set of COM objects, which is what Panagon is, and they've done a very
good job.  But I still miss the old days of FileShare, gum, and baling twine.)
<p>
Unfortunately, there is very little online information to link to about Mezzanine, as it really
predates the advent of the popular Web.  Its technical audience has traditionally been large
organizations, hence the primary mode of information transfer has always been classes given by
Saros/FileNET or by third parties, and no technical information is really accessible online.

<a name=features>
<center><font face=arial size=+1>FEATURES</font></center></td></tr>

<tr><td>
<ul>
<li><strong>API flexibility.</strong>  It's quite easy to write any sort of integration with Mezzanine.
<li><strong>Search capabilities.</strong>  Both metadata and content searches are supported in a very robust manner.
<li><strong>Stability and age.</strong>  Mezzanine is a very stable document-management engine.
<li><strong>Support.</strong>  Since Mezzanine isn't cheap, FileNET pays a lot of attention to their customers.
In addition, there is a large number of third-party integrators and solution providers who understand something of
Mezzanine (including <a href=/services.html>Vivtek, of course!</a>).
</ul>

<li><a href=/linkout/www.filenet.com>FileNET home page</a> but you won't find anything Mezzanine-specific there these days.
<li><a href=/panagon.html>Our Panagon topic page</a> has some information relating to Mezzanine.
</ul>
Vivtek has a few inhouse Mezzanine debugging and spy tools that we intend to spruce up and
put on sale.  We've been using them for some time, and they're very useful in the Panagon
environment, too, which makes them somewhat viable.  Once they're ready, we will link this page
to those tool pages, where you will
be able to find some further technical information.
