<strong>Debugging</strong>
<P>The Toon-o-Matic Take 2 is almost producing the first episode of Toonbots v2.0. It's slow going. I had kind of hoped to have at least basic panel layout done on the 21st, just for neatness's sake, but it looks like the October 21, 2006 episode will be done on October 23 or 24 instead. Ha.
<P>But at least I'm having some fun with it.

<P>Wow. If you do debug it either later today or on the 24th, I shall consider it a birthday present. I turn 26 today. The slog through life's vale of tears continues, but now I can do it with brownies and Pogo books and strange sudden loss of circulation in my legs, hands, and now face.

<P>Happy B-day!!
<P>If you're experiencing loss of circulation, my first reaction is maybe you should stay away from the brownies and stick with the Pogo.

<P>Yeah, I'm going to have it looked into. My dad's a diabetic, and I know circulatory problems are often a sign. I'm hoping that's not what it is (I'd miss cheesecake, though I know you and your family have done without far more in that direction, sympathy). I've had similar problems, years ago, but they went away. I've also been having massive headaches and stuff, and lingering backpains from a broken bed frame which it too the landlady almost three months to fix, so if I can get in, a general check-up wouldn't hurt.
<P>On a plus side, next week I'm reading a paper in a semi-formal atmosphore, for the Syracuse English Graduate Organization (appropriately enough, EGO for short), on &quot;Tulips Shall Grow: An Exploration of the Fringe Status of the Cartoon Short.&quot; And I'm experiencing the joy of NetFlix, and have strange Dutch movies in my queue, as well as a forgotten Dom DeLuise sitcom.

<strong>Re: Debugging</strong>
<P>happy birthday, emsworth! stick with the pogo (like you need that advice), there are sugar-free versions of cheesecake, hope the rest of you feels better soon.
<P>and netflix is great. i just watched &quot;the man who laughs&quot;, 1928, conrad veidt and mary philbin, and zimbo as homo the wolf. wonderful selection of stuff (although oddly, they don't have the 1973 version of &quot;the three musketeers&quot;, with christopher lee, fay dunaway and charlton heston as the bad guys).
