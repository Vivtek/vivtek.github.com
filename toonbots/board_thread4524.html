<strong>::wolverines devour large flocks of turkeys::</strong>
<P>Happy Anniversary of the Day Set Aside Both to Commemorate the Arrival of a Group of English Settlers on Our Shores and Also As a Day to Give Thanks, The Date of Which has Been Changed Over The Years and I've SUddenly Forgotten What Roosevelt Had to Do With It.
<P>And I miss the Pink Panther balloon on the Macy's parade. The dinosaur from the Kraft Macaroni and Cheese commercials doesn't do a thing for me.

<strong>Re: ::wolverines devour large flocks of turkeys::</strong>
<P>and to you also! (roosevelt declared t-day official in it's current location - i can't remember whether it was during the depression or wwii - you know, when you think about it, he must have spent his entire time in office trying to figure out how to cheer people up.)
<P>i personally am giving up on parades. i had the tv turned on (no sound - gave up on sound _years_ ago) - happened to glance at it and ronald mcdonald was floating down the street. this was just way to much to cope with on any number of levels, so i'm gonna just stick with npr.

<P>Hey, at least you missed the WWF (or WWE now) float, as well as the giant Pikachu, and Katie Couric asking in regards to the Animal Planet float, &quot;Who let the crocs out?&quot;
<P>Actually, local parade was much better than Macy's, in my opinion. Mariachis, 15-20 dogs in bandannas or reindeer antlers, a Wells Fargo wagon, Shriner cars, majestic street cleaning units (which Macy's always seems to overlook), and we even had four character balloons this year, including Bullwinkle!

<P>*sigh* why do they keep up this sad charade of on-air talent being spontaneously 'funny'?

<P>local parades are much more what parades are all about. and i love dogs in antlers. dogs seem to enjoy things like parades so much - i always think it sad that they get to particpate so rarely.
<P>my town (i have heard) has something similar to the doo-dah parade, but i never seem to see any billing for it - _that_ i would go to see.
