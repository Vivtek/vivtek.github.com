<strong>Technical difficulties?</strong>
<P>Is anybody but Napoleon having troubles with anything on this site? Please, email me when there are problems -- I host customers here. (They're usually quick enough to tell me in no uncertain terms if I've failed to notice a problem, but ...)
<P>Nappy, everything's copacetic for me, but (1) my dialup is local to the ISP where the box is co-located and (2) I'm running Netscape and you may not be and you just *never know*.

<strong>Re: Technical difficulties?</strong>

<P>Odd. I only have trouble when using Netscape. It seems to interpret the relative links as being off the root directory (obviously a bug. I'm using Communicator 4.75 for Linux in case you're curious). Mozilla, otoh, interprets all of them just fine. I dunno.

<P>Here at home using IE 5.5, everything works perfectly. However, the lab computers at school (which run IE 5.0) wouldn't load the comic, and had the relative-link problem gopher mentioned.
<P>OSes in question are Windows ME here, Windows 2000 there.
<P>If that helps at all.

<strong>Re: Technical difficulties?</strong>

<P>I've had problems in the morning, for some reason. From home or work, occaisionally I'll get 404s for everything but the main page, and a broken link to the comic on the main page. It happens whether I'm following links or typing in the URL by hand. So far, if I move on and try back later everything is okay. I just thought those must be times that you were fiddling around with the workings of the system.
<P>If it had become an extended problem I'd have tracked down your email address and let you know. I hates being out of contact with my suppliers when I need a fix. ;)

<P>No, I was just using my appointed title. I figure there has to be some manual control involved, since the Napster uses a diiferent email address almost every time she posts. Either Michael will catch it or I'll be a few posts short. Either way is fine by me. :)

<P>There is no manual control, but having an infinite number of monkeys available to code scripts does help.

<strong>Re: Technical difficulties?</strong>
<P>It seems to be related to whether or not a trailing slash is used in the URL. If I use &quot;http://www.vivtek.com/toonbots/&quot; it works fine, but &quot;http://www.vivtek.com/toonbots&quot; breaks.

<P>That was indeed the problem -- I change my mind a lot about how to organize my pages, and so I have custom code which looks for the page I probably had in mind -- turns out it was looking a little *too* well, and returning a page for /toonbots as well as /toonbots/ instead of forwarding /toonbots to /toonbots/...
<P>Thanks, Napoleon, for bringing it up, and thanks gopher for tracking it down!
