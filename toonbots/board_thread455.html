<strong>Dec. 29 (Hold the Mao!)</strong>
<P>&gt; Eventually I'm going to dissociate to the point of complete schizophrenia.
<P>Well, if today's blurb was any indication, that's what happened!
<P>First, I noticed that Mao had returned, then I noticed that the strip seemed larger than usual. It was really quite anjoyable, building upon the personality given to Mao in previous installments. Particularly liked the last panel.
<P>Then I saw the blurb.
<P>There's no denying it, Toonbots is continuing to become weirder and yet more compelling and thought provoking with each installment. Bravo, Michael!

<P>Using &quot;its&quot; would have seemed ackward. I suspect that Dot has no gender, but using a pronoun not associated with a gender usually implies a lack of human intelligence.

<P>Ha! Dot has no gender, but as a test, I try to keep a female gender in mind, then I consider it a challenge never to get into a verbal situation where a pronoun would be required. It's tricky. Keeps me thinking. Same thing applies to the Toonbot.

<strong>Re: Gender-specific language</strong>
<P>Just posting to keep this around a little longer, so there's something other than the monster thread still around next week.
<P>I'd kept meaning to reply to Pooga's post in the Dec. 23 thread (regarding voice actor Skip Hinnant (recently found a website which has various voice actor demos available on mp3, and included Skip Hinnat's, playing a vacuum cleaner and a toilet bowl, and other bits that sounded like excerpts from 70's commercials.) For the record, Skip Hinnant also played Pogo in the obscure stop motion feature &quot;Pogo for President&quot; (which also featured Jonathan Winters, Stan Freberg, and according to IMDB, Vincent Price as Deacon Mushrat, though I find that slightly surprising), and was also heard in &quot;My Little Pony&quot; in the 80's.

<P>No cause for alarm. Aside from the fact that we're seperated by great distance, and the impracticality of such a scheme (be unwise to attempt to dine on someone who can skillfully throw you out of a window), as well as moral qualms, my digestive system is not always ideal. I have a rather weak stomach, and expect such a dietary lifestyle would prove very unwise indeed.

<P>I kept meaning to back off anyway (meant to quite after my reply to the prune comment.) I just looked at the time. I can't believe I let myself get caught up in this, or that I spent nearly two hours at it. I think this just goes to show that its probably a good thing that jihad members aren't usually online at the same time. I stopped to eat, and now I have to finish a one page paper for political science (due tomorrow), and study for a theater arts exam on Friday and a Spanish test on Monday. Still, this was kind of fun. Mentally exhasting, but fun. I wonder what Michael thinks of all this.
<P>Anyway, sorry for distracting you, and hope you farewell on your studies, O beloved High Chancellor.

<strong>Re: Annoying Animated Creatures</strong>
<P>&gt; I'm not sure whether to be afraid of that or not, since I don't know of
<BR>> any such show. Man... just when it was getting fun, too.
<P>Oh. That one was from the 60's. The tune was kind of neat, but the lyrics were a trifle annoying. &quot;One Banana, Two Banana, Three Banana, Four, One Banana Makes a Bunch and so do Many More...&quot; Then came the obnoxious chorus &quot;Trallaa, trala, la, la, tra la la, tralala la!!!&quot; ad nauseum.
<P>I thought it was getting fun too. Hm... How about &quot;Denver, the Last Dinosaur?&quot;

<P>Bah. That's easy enough to disable. If I wanted webpages to make noise, I'd lick my finger and rub it across the monitor. Or I suppose printing them out and crumpling them up works, too. Hrm...save a tree, or keep my monitor clean...

<strong>Re: Wanton Name Changes</strong>
<P>Staring at the thread listings, and this thread in particular, I was pondering whether &quot;wanton&quot; was really the best choice of word for this subject. I will post a few of the relevant definitions from the 10th edition of Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary to contemplate
<P>wanton: adj.
<P>1b. playfully mean or cruel, mischeivous
<P>3a. merciless, inhumane
<P>b. havig no just foundation or provocation, malicious
<P>4 being without check or limitation
<P>I suppose that definition 4 fits, and I suppose that Michael might see it as malicious, depending on how difficult it is to link all those posts into the same count. Therefore, the word stands, and the crisis is averted.

<P>It was that way just for him until Napoleon posted as &quot;Napoleon the spinach lady&quot; and now she's got a special name finder, too. Any abuse or unlicensed tested of the name finder will be punished by defenestration (of course) or I'll think of something else, like looking at the browser type, because something tells me gopher isn't going to sign up with AOL to emulate Emsworth.

<P>Actually, I have quite a collection of &quot;700 hours free!&quot; AOL CDs (Office Depot said I could take as many as I wanted. I think I counted 54), but they have been slowly making their way into a microwave after which they are put to work as coasters and wall decorations and the like. I think my roommate uses AOL, I suppose I could use that...
