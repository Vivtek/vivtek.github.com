<P>At least I come up on the second page. Shortly after &quot;Michael Roberts executed on Feb 10, 2000&quot;. And a letter of clemency from the ACLU to the governor on my behalf.... And then there's my BA in Music in 1971, and my ICANN directorship.
<P>Kinda eerie.

<strong>Re: *Gulp* ever search for your own name on Google</strong>
<P>about _time_ someone posted here! here i've been suffering through waves of work alternating with periods of depression, and NO DISTRACTIONS. honestly, you people - what do i pay you for, anyway?
<P>well, i mean....you know, i _would_ pay you, if i had money and stuff .... although i would hate to cheapen the relationship....
<P>um, what was the topic again?
<P>&gt; At least I come up on the second page. Shortly after &quot;Michael Roberts
<BR>> executed on Feb 10, 2000&quot;. And a letter of clemency from the ACLU to
<BR>> the governor on my behalf....
<P>see, that's what you get for having 'wayne' as a middle name. try it without that.
<P>&gt; And then there's my BA in Music in 1971,
<P>wow - when you were what, 4? i'm seriously impressed.
<P>i tried mine, just for fun. my name seems to have been an extremely popular one for brides in the 1800's - huge number of geneology pages. and in the middle was a listing for a paper i was co-author on - had this moment of existential panic, thinking one of my namesakes had been related to people who had the _exact_ _same_ names as my co-workers......
<P>&gt; Kinda eerie.
<P>to say the least.
<P>although at least i have apparently avoided execution. but it _was_ sweet of the aclu to ask for clemency for you...

<P>*snf* _i_ don't care.....
<P>actually, i'm feeling much better....weird thing is, i thought i had figured out what i was depressed about - and that wasn't it at all. so now i don't know _what_ that was all about.

<strong>:wolverines devour depression &amp; feeling ignore</strong>
<P>&gt; *snf* _i_ don't care.....
<P>Pardon, developed a sudden and rather absorbing obsession with the SNES RPG game Earthbound, played on an emulator, and was so stuck with fighting fireplugs and mad taxis and giant ants that I never replied. And today I've been trying to input as many of my feature animation entries into the Toonjunkies database as possible. Going to try to finish this weekend, leaving the layout and bug fixing and the missing blog and source page and whatnot to Michael (still, almost a reality at last!), before I leave for California on Tuesday. Sympathy about the depression, just hope it isn't clinical, or the sort that gives you an uncontrollable urge to beat your head against the wall (something which worried my parents a good deal.)
<P>The first result that comes up for my name on Google is my listing as a contributor to Voicechasers.org. After that, it appears that my namesakes have been noteworthy athletes, of all things, and somewhere on the second page is the list of the UTEP scholarship recipients of 1999, including my name and the name of the school I was attending at the time. No executions, or anything interesting like that.

<BR>> fireplugs and mad taxis and giant ants that I never replied.
<P>well, ok.....that i can understand.
<P>&gt; ... (still, almost a reality at last!)
<P>congratulations! - i look forward to seeing the whole thing.
<BR>> Sympathy about the depression, just hope it isn't

<BR>> head against the wall.
<P>no, just some sort of random tense, uneasy, sad thing - had me doing things like figuring out how long it had been since i spoke to various members of my family, and wondering if it was some sort of psychic message that something had happened to someone (which, since i don't believe in such things, was really unnerving) (and everyone seems to be fine). thought for a while it was fear because the board of my homeowner association is talking about hitting everyone up for a large assessment for &quot;improvements&quot;, but that is still in the hopper, and i seem to be dealing with it ok. no idea _what_ it was about.
<P>(and for me, the head-beating thing is strictly work-related.)
<P>by the way, hope _you_ are doing better - since you've been posting a bit more, i have been thinking positive thoughts. and disneyland is always a good choice (just bring plenty of sunscreen)

<strong>Re: :wolverines devour depression &amp; feeling ig</strong>
<P>&gt; congratulations! - i look forward to seeing the whole thing.
<P>The thing, as it stands, can be seen here: http://toonjunkies.com Only the animated features section is working. The Walt Kelly animator page *was* up, but it's not linked to from the main site at the moment and I've forgotten the URL.

<P>Perhaps it's best to forget about it. Sometimes one *does* need to find the roots of things, but other times one can get along better by just letting it go and moving on. And eating more cheese.
<P>&gt; by the way, hope _you_ are doing better - since you've been posting a bit

<P>Well, looking forward to this trip and spending time with Aunt Pixie. And then classes resume, and while I'll have a full schedule, I'm better off having something to occupy myself, and hopefully the stress will be considerably less, and I won't have any crippling accidents involving buildings on campus.

<P>Still a junior. Three semesters to go (would have been two had it not been for the accident.)
