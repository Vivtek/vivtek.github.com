<strong>Book: _Storm Front_, by Jim Butcher: 10</strong>
<P>A gritty detective novel set in Chicago, from the perspective of one Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden: wizard for hire. The only one in the Chicago Yellow Pages. A little like Harry Potter for grownups (although I must say that so far, Harry Potter #4 is an excellent read; just started it today).
<P>The first by Butcher, it says it's the first in the new series &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; -- I certainly hope this will be the case, because it's an exceptionally excellent first novel. Well-written, suspenseful, full of vibrant and only slightly unbelievable characters: Dresden himself, Murphy the cop, mafioso Jimmy Marcone, a vampire (who runs a brothel), a demon or two, faeries, and a minivan-driving soccer mom. And the Bad Guy, of course. Hoo boy.
<P>For all you webtoon junkies, this is a shoe-in. Read it.

<P>a book, on the other hand, i always seem to find time for. since my reading this summer has been a combination of terry pratchett and catching up on the last couple of lindsey davis' falco mysteries, this should fit right in....

<P>Yeah, books are something fully indelible from my daily life. I read science fiction and some fantasy voraciously, at a rate sometimes dismaying considering what novels cost nowadays. I only buy paperback, though -- and mass market paperback at that; even trade is too rich for my blood, not to mention that since I already have upwards of 500 paperbacks in my collection, trade paperbacks and hardbacks don't fit my boxing standards anyway. (They're in airtight plastic boxes because sometime soon we'll be moving. Somewhere.)
<P>I'm considering putting up a SF book database with a pointer to what I'm reading at any given time, and maybe a short review.

<P>the toonbots book club! we could replace oprah!
<P>i want to come up with some sort of database just to track the books i own. theoretically i will do this when i clean out the second room and put in decent bookcases and shelve stuff in some sort of rational order (yeah, right). now i am continually in the state of knowing i own a book, but being unable to find it. what with this, and the expense of buying books, i have become a huge library patron.
