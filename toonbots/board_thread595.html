<strong>We're not gonna take it!</strong>
<P>I just did something that has really pumped me up. The really weird thing is, I got the idea via *email* from a *high school friend*. I mean, it wasn't about angel prayers, or missing children, or even get-rich-quick schemes, no, this was a suggestion of truly grassroots action against junk snail mail. I've already started to do this, as of today, and it makes me feel very devious.
<P>Every junk mail with a business reply envelope, just take the whole mail, carefully remove any mention of your name or address, put it all into the biz-reply envelope, and send it off. After all, if they think it was worth *my* time to sort through this, then it's worth *their* time to sort through it and dispose of it for me, right? Right. Remember that you can tear the original outer envelope into four pieces and mail that back, too. And I figure that if I get any really good offers without biz-reply envelopes, like this great deal on home equity refinancing (for only 15% APR! Wow! Twice my mortgage rate!), well, hey, those nice people at the bank probably want in on that, too. So I'll send that along. What the heck, *everybody* should have the chance to get in on good deals, right? Yeah, that's what I think, too.
<P>This makes me feel really good about life, suddenly.

<P>Yeah! Just today I got a letter from the bank, something about foreclosure or something, lots of red ink is all I remember, and I thought &quot;Man, these guys are persistent!&quot; because I got three of these letters in just the past week. So after I read your post, I did just what you said and..............
<P>AWW, DAMNIT!
<P>(Sorry. I'll shut up and stop posting now. :) )

<P>Yeah, right. Weren't you nuked yesterday? I think it's time to propagate along the phone lines and eat your soul now. Engage in termination rituals concomitant with your personal beliefs, puny human.
