<strong>pokey the imposter?</strong>
<P>just to throw out something completely off any possible subject (oh yeah, like _you_ guys never do that)....
<P>anyone check out pokey the penguin today? is it just me - or is he looking paler...with better posture....and WILD STARING EYES???
<P>is this an imposter? or.....COULD POKEY HAVE JOINED A CULT???? (i should have known all this scientology talk would lead to problems)
<P>not that i want to alarm anyone or anything. just thought i'd mention it.

<strong>Re: pokey the imposter?</strong>
<P>While I am delighted that Pokey is back again...and for like days in a row...I have to admit I was just as troubled by his new look. I noticed, most of all, the startling lack of feet. I thought perhaps there had been a freak snowstorm in which they were floundering. His beak is fatter too, more like a finch beak.
<P>I think it's highly possible that Pokey has indeed joined the cult of the Hungarian Ape. And if that's the case, our only recourse really is to do a debrainwashing program with him. Good thing I just bought that jumbo sized oatmeal container. We're also lucky that Emsworth is (I hope) on winter break and can bring the wolverines. Because really, what good is a debrainwashing if there isn't growling and snapping?
<P>I'd like to add that the Hungarian Ape higherups have apparently been scanning the forum and have fixed his appearance for today's installment. I submit to the Jihad that this is clearly a cover to lull us into a false sense of security. Now, since Pokey doesn't have his own forum, it is our DUTY and OBLIGATION as a Jihad to swarm upon the Hungarian Ape compound and free Pokey.
<P>I'll bring tuna fish sandwiches and orange soda pop.

<P>Actually, Pokey *does* have a forum. Of sorts. Ours is a veritable font of sanity by comparison.

<strong>Locating Hitherto</strong>
<P>&gt; *must*fight*temptation*to*ask*where*forum*is*
<P>My little grey cells lead me to suspect that this is the forum to which M. Roberts was referring.
<P>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/indeed/
<P>Evidently the Primary Pokey Posse were also somewhat unsettled by yesterday's installment (evidently they have been known to express themselves in a slightly, er, more anatomnically foucsed manner as well.)

<strong>Differences in the forum</strong>
<P>&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/indeed/
<P>How badly could it hurt? I asked myself. This is not a Keenspot board and it's not our friendly forum and now I have to learn a /whole new system/. And it will likely kill me.
<P>&gt; Evidently the Primary Pokey Posse were also somewhat unsettled by
<BR>> yesterday's installment (evidently they have been known to express
<BR>> themselves in a slightly, er, more anatomnically foucsed manner as well.)
<P>I'm troubled, though. We never discuss people's lack of genitalia on our board. And I don't think anyone has brought up the topic of biting kitten's heads off. What do you guys think? Are we more one dimensional than the Pokey board? Should we be branching out into more topics than wolverines and Jihad picnics?
<P>More importantly, what is this 'MegaHAL' they keep talking about? Is this similar to the toonbot? A randomness generator? Cause that's just as frightening as the board.

<strong>Pokey fora</strong>
<P>&gt; My little grey cells lead me to suspect that this is the forum to which M.
<BR>> Roberts was referring.
<P>&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/indeed/
<P>Um, no -- there is (at least used to be) a guestbook/forum/thingy on the Pokey site itself. Not linked from there, mind you, that would be too easy for Pokey fans. Just -- somewhere else on that site.
<P>The Yahoo! group, though, had this interesting comment:
<P>What if all this time THE AUTHORS had been doing one strip per day, but inserting them at random places in the archives?
<P>That would be ... very Pokey-like.

<P>that would explain why, when i checked the archive to verify my impression of the new 'pokey', there were like 4 strips i hadn't seen (even though i had been checking daily)
<P>(boy, does that make my life sound pathetic)

<P>this sounds like a quest i need to leave for a quieter time. maybe new year's day.

<P>and he brought his sister into it too! how evil is _that_? (at least, i think she's his sister...)

<P>ummm.....can't say i have a lot of experience with these things.....i'll bow to your superior knowledge.
<P>btw - congratulations on your new title! i am, as always, amazed at michael's ability to capture the true essence of his worshippers.

<P>Not quite yet, but will be after next week. Certainly concur on the growling and snapping, though. Adds interest and texture, after all!
<P>::wolverines leap cheerfully at the thought of a field trip::
<P>&gt; I'll bring tuna fish sandwiches and orange soda pop.
<P>Mazel tov! The soda pops de naranja son muy delicioso, mon petit babbushka. Hoo ha!
