<strong>I still don't get it</strong>
<P>the comic I mean. But somehow while reading the archives I began to laugh at the complete lack of sence in it, so I guess it works for me. Thanks.
<P>Take Care DFG (who is somewhere in February now)

<P>Aha. You *do* get it, then.

<strong>Re: I still don't get it</strong>
<P>Ack! I'd replied to this one earlier (and the post actually did appear), and now it's gone!
<P>Ah, well. We'll see if this post appears.
<P>Ahem. While the Jihad hierarchy might have to consider whether such statements border on treason or heresy, on the whole, your admission that Toonbots amuses you is more significant than any failure to comprehend the minimalist, absurdist, avant garde, rhythmic, and/or satirical thrust of any given strip. So may you go forth and continue to enjoy the archives. Beware Mao's piercing gaze, however.

<strong>Re: I still don't get it</strong>
<P>Don't get it? Dont GET it?
<P>Beheaded dead communists and hyperbolic contemporary capitalists bantering and rhyming in Seussian prose? Metacartoonist fifth-wall humor while exploiting the nature of the toon-o-matic construct? Vague forum in-circle humor with wolverines and minimalist characters?
<P>Ok, so it's fairly complicated. People ask me to explain the toonbot's I have posted on my walls and my general commentary is:
<P>&quot;Well you see... it's like... well, that's Lenin and that's Dubya and.... uh... nevermind&quot;
<P>They shake their heads, look at the autographed original Chopping Block (tee-hee) and BoxJam printouts and shake their heads again. Then they leave me alone.
<P>So don't worry if you don't GET it right away. It grows on you. Soon, you won't be able to explain it to anybody outside the Jihad either.

<strong>Getting Toonbots</strong>
<P>*kind of....sidesteps Tirdun's enthusiastic thingie there...*
<P>As the newest member of the Jihad and therefore the one most likely to be clinging to the majority of her sanity...I have input on this issue! When I started reading toonbots, I was enjoying the insanity like Emsworth and Tirdun suggest (at least, I think that's what's being suggested. Sometimes I get confused), but what I would really suggest is a perusal of the forum files for the time period of the toon you're looking at.
<P>I realize this can seem daunting because some of us (ahem) are rather prolific in our postings. However, a lot of the things that just seem totally off the wall have their roots in something that someone said on the forum. And there's a whole level of joke (is this that meta thing? I'm still floundering with the theory of comics, cause you know, I'm just a normal joe, not an ar-tist.) underlying the general insanity that makes the comic that much more meaningful. Kind of.
<P>You know what I mean. Right?
