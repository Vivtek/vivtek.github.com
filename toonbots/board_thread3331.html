<strong>an idee, fixed</strong>
<P>sincel my attempt to sneak a toon idea out into discussion has been roundly ignored, i am forced to grasp it firmly by the scruff of the neck and cast it, kicking and screaming, into the limelight. therefore, i herewith present, with full XML orchestration:
<P>MOUSE'S TOONBOT IDEA:
<P>MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE MASSACREE:
<P>the horror....the horror...
<P>Len, that's a different movie. Besides, you're a communist - it's better to have a running-dog capitalist company owning Pickle Crisp anyway
<P>Um, guys? Shouldn't we be trying to finish the storyline?
<P>Guys?
<P>We're waiting for the theme to come around again
<P>We have a theme?
<P>Blurb: impelled by the twin horns of terror of a toonless future and outright ego(t)ism, mouse seizes the reins in her teeth and lashes the toon-o-matic into action. fasten your seatbelts, boys, it's going to be a bumpy ride.

<P>Who's saying &quot;Um, guys?&quot; You? If so, what color is your caption? Are you present in the frame or are you in the metacartoonist's chair? Who's saying &quot;We have a theme?&quot;
<P>This is a super-dee-duper episode. (Ahem. Barney's Great Adventure, by age group: 2-year-old: 9.5, 7-year-old: 8.5, 35-year-old: 6.5. There were some rather clever lines, actually, and the whole thing wasn't nearly as horrible as the TV show. My son really enjoyed it, though. He likes Barney and he also likes eggs, so this movie really clicked for him.)

<strong>Ignoring Ignorance</strong>
<P>I didn't ignore it! I just...couldn't think of anything witty to say about it. Yeah.
<P>&gt; Except the wolverines seem to have eaten the XML.
<P>We have to do XML, too? Gah! I look at it sometimes, but it never makes a smidge of sense to me at all.
<P>&gt; Who's saying &quot;We have a theme?&quot;
<P>That sounds like a Mao statement to me, but that's just my personal opinion.
<P>&gt; This is a super-dee-duper episode. (Ahem. Barney's Great Adventure, by age
<BR>> group: 2-year-old: 9.5, 7-year-old: 8.5, 35-year-old: 6.5. There were some

<BR>> horrible as the TV show. My son really enjoyed it, though. He likes Barney
<BR>> and he also likes eggs, so this movie really clicked for him.)
<P>You know, my heart can't take scares like this. I just got over the wraith popping out from behind that tree. Please, no Barney references first thing in the morning? At least warn me in the subject line so I have time to prepare. (WARNING: May contain explicit verbage or Barneys)

<P>Nah, I'll take script form, too. But you have to write the blurb (or get mouse to do it).

<strong>i meant to do that</strong>
<P>....it was an extremely subtle joke, spoofing the inherent inconsistencies of XML script and WebBBS, playing on the anxieties of the jihad (of the prospects of your silence and my loquacity), capped with a gentle jibe at same.
<P>&gt; This is a super-dee-duper episode.
<BR>> and he also likes eggs, so this movie really clicked for him.
<P>um, should i be worried about this conjunction of terms? dig out my egg-proof shirt?
<P>anyway: here now, the real thing (with stupid angle brackets replaced by square brackets, so _you_ will just have to put those all back) - and also some other stuff i thunk up later: (also i put in comments in curly brackets, just for character clarification - i would never put myself in the toon, my self-aggrandizement is limited to mention in the blurbs)(also for the most part, i am just guessing on how long a line i can make before i need a break) (this also seems to be lacking line feeds. i put in line feeds - now i'll put in # to signify end-of-line, and extra line feeds between panels)(next time, i'll write it in chinese, which will be _much_ clearer)

Dot, having washed her hands of the entire plotline, is in negotiations with Dubya to get a tax break for the revitilization of the dot-com industry.

<P>&gt; (you mean i actually got XML _right_?)
<P>Pretty close. I split the first panel because the captions overlapped (they do that a lot, actually) and you had the introductory caption as orange although it's traditionally blue (for shame!), and instead of [panel][/panel] XML allows you to write [panel/] -- but other'n that, it was just find-and-replace. The best XML submission I've ever had. And very relaxing to read a Toonbots I didn't have to write. It's kind of like going out to eat.

<P>&gt; The best XML submission I've ever had.
<P>Hummph. You never did try to fix my incorrect XML or post it to the main page. (Had made some corrections on the code myself for re-submittal, and then lost the dashed document!)
<P>All pettiness aside, congratulations to mouse for the capital efforts. Been mostly pre-occupied of late with other things, primarily research and work on my own project, a resource on animated features which I had been *hoping* to put online in the near future (not sure how much further I'll get in the few days before classes resume.) May try to finish coding an entry or two of my own if time allows after that, but in the mean time, mouse seems to have it nicely handled. Again, good show, mouse, old thing!
