<strong>Spam, spam, bacon, eggs, and spam...</strong>
<P>I've been trying to keep afloat on this board for at least half an hour now but every time I've read a post, two more new ones have appeared.
<P>O High Priest: if the Jihad doesn't currently have some official mechanism (other than windows) by which to conduct court-martials, can we create one? And in any case:
<P>*defenestrates Emsworth and Napoleon*
<P>There. I feel better now. :)

<P>Hmm...using defenestration as a means of trial as well? Sounds good. We could throw each offending party out of a window, and if anyone gets up, we repeat the defenestration. Once everyone's lying on the ground under the windows the problem's solved. I'll try to think of something better, though, since our High Chancellor of Defenestration is one of the offending parties.

<strong>An Apology</strong>
<P>I apologize for any annoyance or inconvenience I might have caused. I did not intend to spam the borad at all. I simply checked the forum, noticed Michael's message to the effect that I was in the lead, and then replied to it, before checking the rest of the days posts. While I was replying to those, Napoleon had replied to mine, I replied to hers, and so on. We just happened to be online and on the message board at the same time, and I suppose I was a bit starved for conversation, and before I knew it, I was swept up.
<P>However, may I point out that gopher was the first to spam the board, and that most of the messages posted by myself and Napoleon had some content to them, and we replied to each other, but did not reply to ourselves. Besides, gopher was the first to claim I was a cannibal, and it sort of snowballed from there. I don't care that much about post counts or ranks, I just happened to get caught up in the conversation. The &quot;wanton name changes&quot; occurred because, well, I guess I just got bored entering &quot;Lord Emsworth&quot; all the time.
<P>I usually don't post that much, after all, as I generally try to confine most of my comments to Toonbots itself, and generally try to sound reasonable. Today, I guess I just had too much fun with the nostalgia and all, and got carried away, and I apologize. It will probably never happen again, as I simply wouldn't have the energy (it was quite an exhausting experience) and really don't have the time. I apologize again. I try very hard not to offend or annoy people, really. If its any consolation to gopher, keep in mind that I can not keep up that sort of pace at all, and you can catch up over the next few days, if you need to. Michael, if it annoys you too much, feel free to archive the thread.
<P>Once again, I apologize, and will try not to let it happen again. Still, I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a conversation so much, and I rarely have a chance to talk with anyone for very long in real life. And I happen to like the &quot;Super Chicken&quot; theme as well (buck buck). Thank you.
<P>

<P>Yeah, blaming it all on me, again. I *will* pass you again! As soon as I figure out how far that is!

<P>You know, I can never tell when individuals are seriously annoyed or not. For the most part, I say what I mean, and tend to take others on face value, so despite the defenestration talk, I couldn't tell if you were all really annoyed at us, or not.
<P>I still think it would be quite awhile before I did that again. I really didn't intend to do it, I just happened to be on at the same time as Napoleon. It was fun, and it might be nice to try again in the distant future, but that was rather exhausting. I'm probably going to go to bed early tonight.

<P>That's probably a pretty good idea, although I'm not always the quickest to respond to e-mail (I tend to fret more over e-mail than I do over message board posts.) I think I still have the three versions of the Snork theme song downloaded as .wav themes, if you're interested (found them from a website which has since lost the material, it seems.) Also a handful of other themes, including the one for the animated version of &quot;Alf&quot; (I used to watch that one in Spanish, occasionally.)

<P>Are you suggesting that I would make senseless posts simply for the sake of a post count that is ultimatly meaningless? I am shocked at this seemingly accurate accusation. Perhaps I /won't/ make the two (or is it three? I forget) more posts needed to pass the mark of 70 and simply let you have that top position for a while. Or until Napoleon decides to pass you again.
