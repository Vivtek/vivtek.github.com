<strong>Re: Hurricane gun $13.95 with delivery</strong>
<P>&gt; I don't get it --
<P>And how often does a reader elicit that response from the meta-cartoonist, rather than the other way around? More proof that Jenn is Cool Enough.
<P>&gt;what are you quoting, Jenn?
<P>Michael doesn't read his own forum!
<P>Actually, that would be perhaps the only advantage to that new forum idea, since it would be easier to see all new posts. Self has to go by any additions to the post number at the top of the forum, then scroll down to check any posts for the most recent dates.
<P>Anyway, this is from Jenn's post at the end of the &quot;New Brainchild&quot; thread (after your see), no doubt as an insightfully witty meta-comment on both Florida weather and your ramblings about the Toon-O-Matic:
<P>&quot;Oooooh. I think I see what's happening now.
<P>Didn't you read the warning label on the back of the cranberry juice bottle? I know it's small, but I'm pretty sure it says something about 'combining with Cuba Libres and titanium may cause atmospheric disturbances up to and including gale force winds and hurricanes'.&quot;
<P>And the cranberry juice thing was from your own comments early in that thread: &quot;What goes on behind the scenes is really pretty simple. I write the toon in XML, then print it out and burn it with incense in a pentagram I have drawn in chalk on the rooftop terrace. (I used to have to use the basement floor, and the smoke was kind of nasty.) The vibrations in the ether induced by this process are refracted through a number of prisms I have carefully carved and ground in the shape of Soviet-era statuary and Easter Island heads, and the beam is focussed on a sheet of hammered titanium and fixed with a light spray of cranberry juice.&quot;
<P>Where would you people be without me?

<P>Oy. With my tongue less firmly in my cheek, apparently.
<P>Jenn quoted the Marlboro man, then I changed his posting, and then I innocently asked Jenn what she was quoting.
<P>Oh, never mind.

<strong>Re: Hurricane gun $13.95 with delivery</strong>
<P>Your &quot;I don't get it.. whatr are you quoting&quot; appeared under neath Jenn's &quot;cranberry juice&quot; line, and so didn't make much sense (and besides, the spam message has always been the same, and still exists elsewhere on the forum, so the joke would really only work if you changed *all* of the posts). Pardon for being obtuse again, but really, what do you expect when you constantly attempt to toy with us like this?
<P>I am glad that gopher's hurricane gun concept is now an official part of Toonbots lore, though.
<P>(Gopher and I had noticed the change, and were surprised, as you seemed quite tolerant of the guy. Perhaps it's because this time he was interrupting your SCMUF plans).

<P>It's mostly because (1) he posted again after Jenn responded to this one, i.e. twice in one day and (2) my overall energy level is higher and thus it's much easier to cross that crucial threshold of, you know, actually doing something.

<P>Hrm. Cigarette guy acquires sense of humor ($13.95 with delivery).
<P>Cigarette guy posts more often than Jenn (recently declared Cool Enough, though with the subtitle &quot;Utterly Clueless&quot;).
<P>Is the logical conclusion to this stream that we should offer cigarette guy a position in the Jihad?

<P>No, dear, you're &quot;Smartly Trimmed with Richly Grained Leatherette.&quot; And you currently account for 8.3% of the forum, whereas mcity4 is at only 1.3%. You win.

<P>I kind of already gave him an honorary title. You know, as long as I was in there monkeying with the Grim Thread Reaper.

<P>&gt; [stuff about cranberry labels]
<P>The funny thing is, one could try to make a case that the confusion here is the quote-o-matic's fault, as it has suppressed the text in actual question. Or that said suppression is why Michael must ask.
