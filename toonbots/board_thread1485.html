<P>Good flick! I laughed all the way through! And the animation is truly a work of art. All-around good job.

<strong>Re: Shrek</strong>
<P>&gt; Good flick! I laughed all the way through! And the animation is truly a
<BR>> work of art. All-around good job.
<P>Agreed. I liked this movie so much that I've seen it twice since Saturday and plan to see it at least one more time in the next week.
<P>This is the best fantasy-comedy since The Princess Bride. I was a bit skeptical with Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as the leads, but it really worked. The movie reference jokes were great. Plus it was really designed to worked on multiple levels, so both the adults and the kids could enjoy it.
<P>Even the soundtrack was fairly well matched to the picture, despite using modern songs in a fantasy setting. I even bought the soundtrack CD, which is good but is missing two songs I really wanted: the &quot;Welcome to Duloc&quot; song from the information booth and Monsieur Hood's song. Otherwise it's one of the few soundtrack albums I own where I can actually place almost all the songs with the scenes where they were used.
<P>If there is any justice in the movie business, THIS will be this year's summer blockbuster. I'm not exactly holding my breath on that score, though. CG or not, it's still got the stigma of being an animated movie, which will keep some people away. It also hasn't been tied into every merchandise opportunity under the sun, so it counts as underhyped as these thing go. Still, if word of mouth counts for anything it should do well.
<P>Since I haven't been living up to my duties as High Priest of the Order of Self-Fulfilling Prophecy, I shall now rectify this by making the prediction that all Jihad members who see this movie will greatly enjoy it. So speaks the Pooglian One.
