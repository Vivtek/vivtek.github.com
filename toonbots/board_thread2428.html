<P>Cursed Thread Reaper, I choose you!
<P>(500 posts is too much to have online all at once. Sorry about your standings, everybody.)

<P>&gt; (500 posts is too much to have online all at once. Sorry about your
<BR>> standings, everybody.)
<P>well, _i'm_ happy - i seem to be dominating the boards (and i would like to point out that i considered an extra post yesterday just so i could have post 500 - but i restrained myself) ....altho this seems to be primarily because only 4 of us have posted in, like, ages, which sorta reduces the thrill......
<P>was it because i offered to sing? i really sing very nicely - just listen: *ahem*
<P>i am a singing mouse
<P>i lend distinction to a house
<P>who wouldn't like to see
<P>a singing mouse like me?
<P>see, that wasn't so bad...you guys liked that, right?...right?............hello?
<P>i feel so lonely

<P>Well, it's largely because a certain rodent insists on replying to every single thing posted to this forum. Gad, madame, what do you do at work to have that sort of time? (Glad you showed some restraint, though.)
<P>Seriously, this is just a busy time. For some of us, academic pressures have beenmounting. Others, work pressures or illness or personal situations or priorities or whatnot. I really wouldn't have even been online this week if it hadn't been for Michael's e-mail and the wolverine campaign (which has been less than a rousing success thus far, for much the same reasons), and definitely need to limit my own online activity.
<P>And I'm suddenly reminded of a Christmas episode of the radio series &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; involving a singing mouse. Though that mouse was a tenor, I believe.
<P>

<P>well, i don't exactly _insist_ -- and it isn't absolutely _everything_ -- and anyway think how dead things would be if i _didn't_ keep chattering. at work i run long tedious programs (only less lately because half the office is out of town)(and my best friend who gave me most of the work and with whom i usually chatted aimlessly moved to chicago)
<P>ok, i'll be quiet now

<P>there, see emsworth? i was just doing to keep michael happy (i mean, he is stuck in a basement and everything)
<P>actually i keep hoping if i blather long enough it will stir someone else up, so i can keep amused just by reading.
<P>AND - it looks like i actually will be quiet this weekend because I MAY ACTUALLY HAVE A LIFE - or at least a bunch of stuff to go to.

<P>I rather doubt it, frankly. As I said before, most of the others are busy or absent or dealing with their own concerns. To be more specific, Napoleon's been dealing with school and personal situations and blood loss from a beligerent nose, Schissel's been pre-occupied with work programming, Tim Bram's back in chemo, Chris also has school, have no idea what's going on with Pooga and goper and the rest (may e-mail them soon), and frankly, lately, trying too keep up on this forum is becoming a strain and is rather less fun than it was in the old days (I fear it may be the end of an era), and at the moment even I'm feeling oddly over-wrought and distressed, so I too may have to step aside or at least slow down before long myself.
<P>Again, no offense meant, just an explanation. So if people don't post or comment on your jokes or whatnot, safe to assume they're too busy or pre-occupied or whatnot, and not necessarily because they don't like you (or Michael or Toonbots or anything, for that matter.)
<P>They'll post when they have time, regardless of how much a person says (although at times that can be a factor, yes), but more due to time and personal circumstances and computer access and mental and emotional state and physical health and whatnot. That is all. And I think I need to hug Otu before I cry (as the wolverine campaign has fizzled out, and the cross-over seems to be nearing an end anyway, I think I will do so.)

<P>Gah! I hadn't realized there was such a slow down over here. I've been up to my eyeballs in a coding project and two new classes which have sucked my free time away. I still manage to check all my comic reads every other day or so, and I still keep up with Toonbots, I just haven't managed to post much of anything anywhere recently.

<P>Sympathies, o Arch-uperpopenschnitzel. Having difficulties keeping up with forums myself, what with academic pressures and whatnot.

<P>No offense intended. Perhaps I should have made it clearer, but this was in regard to your professed shock at your post count, not commentary on forum activity.
<P>Myself, I wouldn't care too much if things were deader at present. With papers and family concerns and increased stress and increased personal mental distress and fatigue, I have difficulty posting at all, let alone trying to keep up with you so as to preserve some memory of the once glorious long-established jihad hierarchy, while gopher and Napoleon and the rest are absent or fairly quiet, and to avenge the honour of the wolverines from all would-be usurpers!
<P>Ahem. Or something along those lines.
