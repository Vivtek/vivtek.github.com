<strong>::wolverines devour conversational lulls::</strong>
<P>Down, boys and girls, down! Godfrey, stay away from that corner of the forum! You've had enough fiber in your diet this week!
<P>Ahem. Somewhat more seriously, the feast of reason and flow of soul seems to have petered out slightly at the moment. Anyone care to discuss anything? Read any good books lately? Care to hear a detailed critique of the recent dish of cinematic tripe known as &quot;Pearl Harbour?&quot; Or discuss caricatures of Hitler in U. S. animated cartoons during World War II? Or the proper grooming habits of the wolverine?
<P>Ah, well.
<P>::wolverines return to their favorite pastime::

<strong>Re: ::wolverines devour conversational lulls::</strong>
<P>That's possibly the most meta posting title I've ever seen. I'm going to have to meditate on it to appreciate its many levels.
<P>&gt; Read any good books lately?
<P>Started three this week: - Niven and Pournelle's new one, _The Burning City_ -- they just get better every decade. - Le Ton Beau de Marot (Douglas Hofstadter) -- been meaning to read this for some time, since he's my doctoral advisor... - When Corporations Rule the World (David Korten) -- I always knew they were evil, but now I'm beginning to gather hard evidence. The Revolution is nearing, and the corporations will be the first with their backs against the wall.
<P>&gt; Care to hear a detailed critique of
<BR>> the recent dish of cinematic tripe known as &quot;Pearl Harbour?&quot;
<P>Not until I've seen it, please. Well, except: is there anything in the movie worth seeing except what was already in the trailer? If not, I'll just see something else and see the trailer again....
<P>&gt; Or discuss caricatures of Hitler in U. S. animated cartoons
<BR>> during World War II?
<P>You and Pooga can do that. I'm just an amateur.
<P>&gt; Or the proper grooming habits of the wolverine?
<P>You're the only one (except Napoleon on good days) who can get close enough to do it. So: not much point in discussion.
<P>&gt; ::wolverines return to their favorite pastime::
<P>Wreaking havoc.

<P>Currently _Ultimate_Hitchhikers_Guide_. In memorial.

<P>I'd rather not. My poor grandfather would haunt me for such things :) I was told to rent the movie just for the harbor attack scenes and be done with it.
