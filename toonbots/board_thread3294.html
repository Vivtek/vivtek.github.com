<strong>Netscape 6</strong>
<P>So I decided that in the new year I'm not going to keep screwing around with Netscape 4.7 and its thousand little hassles, so I upgraded to NS 6.2 (I thought of Mozilla, but I had heard at one point that it didn't grok SSL, and I can't have that.) (Eventually, I'll get around to trying it out.)
<P>So there's one particular thing about NS6.2 I really, really like: its mail client allows me to create multiple identities and select any one of them when sending mail. That's sooooooo much easier than I've had it in the past. Very nice.
<P>I'm enjoying my hiatus. I think I may post an episode later today. Or ... I MIGHT NOT! Ahhhhhhh.

<strong>Re: Netscape 6</strong>
<P>our sysadmin upgraded my os to windows 2000 over the holidays, and he threw in netscape 6.2 as well.....so now i'll probably spend all january figuring out how to use everything. one thing - what is with all these side panels in everything now? like it isn't hard enough for me to read stuff already?!! (growl, snarl, grumble, grsa mrsa always _changing_ stuff - dang newfangled inventions....)

<P>I agree. I dragged all the side panels to the very edge. You can't just make them go away.
<P>I did find one nice thing, though: you can select a &quot;theme&quot; under Edit|Preferences. Hint: use &quot;Classic&quot;. It looks almost exactly like the old Netscape (and renders a heck of a lot faster too. Stupid graphics geeks.)

<P>actually you can make the one i was talking about go away (as i just this minute discovered) - under 'view' uncheck 'my sidebar'.
<P>on the positive side, you can delete tabs to clear things up (i have just spent about 2 hrs. cleaning up my bookmarks, because this is like the third time i have had bookmarks copied over to a new machine, so mine have this incredible nested structure - actually, sorta looks like this forum). so i am starting to become familiarized, against my will.

<P>Woo! (I especially detested the way the sidebar, which I'd dragged shut, sort of helpfully opened up about 100 pixels when I did a Google search, with the corresponding Netscape search results. If I wanted to search at Netscape, dammit, I'd click the numerous search buttons which keep getting in my way!)

<P>You can make it not do searches either, or change the search engine that it uses. NS did a pretty darn good job on 6.2.
<P>Here's a few things that you will almost definitely want to do to rein in some of the more annoying features:
<P>In the Preferences:
<P>- Under the root navigator menu, unclick the icons you don't want. You can quickly unclutter the menubar this way, so you have a nice big URL box again.
<P>- Under navigator -&gt; smart browsing, add a domain of &quot;*&quot; to the &quot;don't search for what's related&quot; box.
<P>- Disable internet keywords, in the same box as above. Location bar autocomplete is OK, and much nicer than the old way.
<P>- Under navigator -&gt; internet search, change the default engine to your preference. However, if you unclick &quot;open the sidebar when search is complete&quot;, it should never do a search unless you ask for one with th search icon, or drag down to the search item in the history popup.
<P>- Under Privacy &amp; security -&gt; Cookies, check &quot;ask me before accepting a cookie.&quot; This is annoying for a short while, but you can very quickly stop all the ad-trackers from tagging your machine. The cookie control is very nice.
<P>Even in 4.7, I always preferred netscape to IE. 6.2 finally brings features into parity, and 6.2 is almost up to the speed of 4.7, if you use the pre-load feature. On the mac, you don't even need to do that. PV
<P>

<P>mine does searches - and i did get it to save my prefered engine, although getting to a search is now a two-step operation (which is tedious)
<P>&gt; Here's a few things that you will almost definitely want to do to rein in
<BR>> some of the more annoying features:
<P>thanks for the info! (i have _got_ to start checking all those things on new software - but it is so incredibly irritating to have to step through them all. what was _wrong_ with command-line anyway?)
<P>&gt; - Under Privacy &amp; security -&gt; Cookies, check &quot;ask me before
<BR>> accepting a cookie.&quot; This is annoying for a short while, but you can

<P>yes - it even shows you all the cookies it has stored - which is a frightening list.

<P>This, at least, is one thing I like about iCab : Shows- and allows you to edit.
