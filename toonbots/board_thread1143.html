<strong>General comments on past installments and such</strong>
<P>Well! I have time to check Toonbots and notice there has recently been an update, and yet upon checking my e-mail, while I did receive notices for the previous installments, absolutely nothing for the current one. Tsk, tsk. (Though as only myself and some other personage, who does not appear to be amongst the jihad, to judge from the unfamiliar adress, seem to be receiving these update notices, I don't suppose it makes much difference.)
<P>Lenin makes a fine foil for the dot, in my opinion. Touching scene with Hick and Chick for March 1. And going further back, while the whole &quot;All Your Base&quot; thing is becoming tiresome by now, it makes more sense when used in &quot;Toonbots&quot; than in, say, &quot;Fox Trot.&quot;
<P>Things seem to have slowed down a bit here in the jihad, though I see that a few new people have posted in my absence. (I still think that establishing a charter for the Jihad could be useful for propoganda purposes, and make our purpose much clearer to the average infidel.)
<P>Surprisingly, it appears that Napoleon has not defenestrated anyone in neary a month (or at least, not on this forum.) Ah, well. Glad to see that the wolverines have been well-taken care of, though.
<P>Ahem, well, not much more to say at the moment. Anyone else care to add something? Anything?
<P>

<P>Good idea. Wanna volunteer to write it? :P

<P>It's hard to work up the enthusiasm to defenestrate when the soul of our Jihad is so woefully absent... *snif, snif, sob*

<BR>> something? Anything?
<P>ITS TIME, a way INWARD FOR FIGURATION.

<P>&gt; Good idea. Wanna volunteer to write it? :P
<P>Actually, I'd rather hoped to hear what the meta-cartoonist thought of the idea (as I'd rather hate to write it up only to have Michael reject it.) However, if I have time, I'll try to finish a short section addressing the defenestration mystique (though afterwards, I'll probably need to check a few things with the High Chancellor, as that is her sphere of influence, after all.)
<P>And only two posts since Friday (well, three counting this one.) Is it just me, or is it a lot slower arond here then it was in the golden days of the jihad. Sigh. Napoleon, I think you and I may need to get online at the same time and discuss old cartoons again (Don't suppose you remember &quot;Foofur,&quot; btw? I rather liked that show, as well as it's theme.)
<P>

<P>Heck yeah. If there's one thing I know, it's defenestration. And Spam. ...if there's two things I know, they're defenestration, Spam... and mutant wombats... I GIVE UP!

<P>Pity. It was about a blue bloodhound and a bunch of strays who lived in this house which had been put up for sale, and constantly tried to dodge the owner and her annoying pet Chihuaha.
<P>Well, how about &quot;The Littles?&quot; &quot;The Get-Along Gang?&quot; &quot;Danger Mouse?&quot; &quot;Chilly Willy??&quot;

<P>Ah, I was thinking &quot;kissyfur&quot; which was a lame care-bears rip. Which is really sad in and of itself.
<P>&gt; Well, how about &quot;The Littles?&quot;
<P>Good one! Idea came straight from a good childrens book, very worth watching. Remember the airplane they had stashed on the roof?! Some actual effort involved in a storyline and probably 24 fps animation.
<P>&gt; &quot;The Get-Along Gang?&quot;
<P>Eh, one of many gaggle-of-cute-misfit cartoons... never cared about it.
<P>&gt; &quot;Danger Mouse?&quot; &quot;Chilly Willy??&quot;
<P>No... Chilly? Wasn't that part of the Woody Woodpecker show? Sort of a dopey penguin and some sort of scientist.. Professor Dingledong?? Dinkledong? Man, that's a stretch...

<P>Danger Mouse! WOWOWOOW! Good stuff!
<P>Chilly Willy was indeed part of the Woody Woodpecker bunch, basically started out as a Droopy knockoff, with Chilly Willy in the Droopy role, and a walrus in the antagonist role.
<P>Our high school principal walked with a distinct little waddle and got the name Chilly Willy. One boy actually got suspended for wearing a Chilly Willy T-shirt once. Nazi Germany had nothing on high schools.

<strong>Re: General comments on past installments and such</strong>
<P>&gt; Danger Mouse! WOWOWOOW! Good stuff!
<P>Indeed. I particularly liked the bits with the Narrator (i'm a sucker for amusing narrators, you know.) Great dialogue, pretty good animation, nice sight gags, and excellent voice work (the bulk of which was done by David Jason, playing Danger Mouse, Col. K, Nero, and Count Duckula, plus many incidentals.) I remember one episode where Count Duckula tries to sing &quot;Thanks for the Memories,&quot; with a vampire back-up group. For some reason, that stuck with me.

<BR>> started out as a Droopy knockoff, with Chilly Willy in the Droopy role,
<BR>> and a walrus in the antagonist role.
<P>Wally Walrus, in fact, though his most common adversary was a St. Bernard named Smedley (voiced by Daws Butler in Southern tones similar to those later used for Huck Hound.) Incidentally, two of teh earliest Chilly Willy shorts were directed by the great Tex Avery, creator of Droopy, so the similarity was far from coincidental.

<P>Well, on the one hand, I kind of like Toonbots and the Jihad to be continually emergent -- you have to be cool enough. On the other hand, the point of the Jihad is that you people are the Jihad. If you want documentation, by all means document.
