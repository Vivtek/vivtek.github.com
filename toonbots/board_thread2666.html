<strong>Idiots</strong>
<P>I take back anything positive I may have said about Geo. W. Bush the past couple of weeks.
<P>Osama: 5,732. Dubya: several hundred and counting. Osama's still ahead.

<strong>Re: Idiots</strong>
<P>On the subject...Heow turns the laptop to me on Sunday, and CNN news (I think it was) had a picture of him sitting in the Oval Office with this doofus look on his face. &quot;This is your president,&quot; Heow says. The man does not appear to have left a single brain cell during his coke and liquor years.
<P>I can only hope that his advisors are somewhat brighter.
<P>(I don't want to do another post, so I'm going to comment here on the ice cream thing from down there. Chinatown Ice Cream Factory has good ice cream. On the list of 'Things that Shouldn't Taste As Good As They Do': Ginger, Red Bean, Taro (kind of potato thing). But I like chocolate, too.)

<strong>Re: Idiots</strong>
<P>&gt; I can only hope that his advisors are somewhat brighter.
<P>so do i - and i hope his good friend vladimir told him some war stories from russia's afghan campaign.
<P>i'm not surprised he did it though - maybe a little surprised he did it so soon -- but maybe they figured, best to start while everyone was still hot. i heard 1 news report sunday where the taliban was claiming civilian casualties (altho they would probably do that if we killed as much as a goat) - but nobody today seems to be reporting actual results. on saturday (what with the taliban offering things up) i was hoping we could just unnerve them by moving troops around, and refusing to negotiate in a foreboding sort of way. oh well - guess this is why i'm not in the cabinet. (which is just _fine_ - there's more room under the bed anyway)
<P>but for all the uproar about bin laden's 'statement', i can't get too panicky about additional terrorist attacks -- this sounds to me like standard terrorist propaganda, ready made for any overt US action. it seems to take them several years to plan the big stuff -- and this and the embassy bombings are the only things that really turned out 'big'. it does bother me a bit that the most reported reaction seems to be fear that now 'they' will hit us again - rather than wondering if this is really the best way to get the desired results. the one thing that would _really_ piss me off would be if ObL's statement about America being full of fear, north to south and east to west, came true -- because that would be _our_ fault.
<P>'course if you _really_ want to scare yourself, you know what the punchline to all this 'long struggle' rhetoric is, don't you? (four more years!)
<P>&gt; On the list of 'Things that Shouldn't Taste As Good As They Do':
<BR>> Ginger, Red Bean, Taro (kind of potato thing). But I like chocolate, too.)
<P>what does taro taste like? i've had taro chips, but can't quite extrapolate to ic. is it purple? red bean is surprisingly excellent (red bean mochi! snack food of champions!) - as is ginger, when i can find it.
<P>chocolate is best for eating under the bed, tho.

<strong>'Idiots' is Appropriate For So Many Things</strong>
<P>&gt; so do i - and i hope his good friend vladimir told him some war stories
<BR>> from russia's afghan campaign.
<P>What, learn from the past? Actually know about the past? That would assume powers of retention. Not that I'm saying anything about our dauntless leader.
<P>&gt; it seems to take them several years to plan the big stuff
<P>Just because I sit around and think too much...it probably took them years to mastermind both the embassy bombings and the WTC. If I had to guess, it seems likely they were working on them at the same time (I tried to call Bin Laden and ask him in person, but the phone lines were down. Hrm.). So what would be the difficulty in working on a third terrorist option while working on the other two? Something easy, say...anthrax release. Course, that's not to say that I'm particularly worried about it. Just...ya know...can't stop thinking.
<P>&gt; 'course if you _really_ want to scare yourself, you know what the
<BR>> punchline to all this 'long struggle' rhetoric is, don't you? (four more
<BR>> years!)
<P>I vote that at the 100th toonbot victory party at Michael's, with ice cream and clowns and the pony (keg, what did you think I meant?), that mouse doesn't get to tell scary stories around the campfire. It's broad daylight and she just made me shiver.
<P>&gt; what does taro taste like?
<P>It's sweet. Kind of starchy, but it doesn't have a heck of a lot of flavor. Imagine vanilla ice cream with less vanilla and more starchy little things. And it's white. The red bean ice cream is a purplely-red.
