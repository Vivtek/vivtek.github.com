<P>As is traditional that I do from time to time:
<P>*picks up entire message board, staggers slightly under load, then with a running start hurls it through a handy window*
<P>Being without Internet for the better part of two months sucks. I don't recommend it.

<P>Not in school right now. Long story. I'll get you next year, accursed education!

<P>Um... maybe. Don't hold your breath. Or do, but don't blame me when you pass out and/or die.

<strong>Re: Blather.</strong>

<P>Yes, but apparently you must choose one or the other, and not both. There can be no middle ground. Unless of course you want to write a book about encounters with death and seeing the white light but suddenly an eerie voice shouted &quot;WOULDN'T YOU RATHER ENJOY A PACK OF H&amp;M SMOKED ANTS?&quot; at which point you felt yourself dragged back, quite possibly by a bear in a hat.

<P>Moose in hat is no bear in hat. Only bear in hat is bear in hat. Am keeping eye on you, little Emsworth man. Spirit of Communism is watching.

<P>you know i love you in or out of a moose hat. (in or out of a moose, too, for that matter)
<P>but if a bear in a hat drags me back from other side, well....i gotta feel _some_ fondness for that.

<strong>Re: Blather.</strong>
<P>Yay!
<P>How's Indy? We lived there for a while. Full of Cancun-obsessed, sterophilic, jet-ski-buying yuppies. But I liked snagging a Big Mac and eating it on the Circle at lunchtime.
<P>So do I gather you're actually living in Broadripple?

<strong>Re: Blather.</strong>
<P>&gt; How's Indy?
<P>Okay as long as I don't go downtown. Too many tall buildings. Freaks me out.
<P>You'd think growing up 20 miles from LA, I'd be of the opposite opinion if anything, but turns out not so much.
<P>&gt; So do I gather you're actually living in Broadripple?
<P>Southport, now. Back at the hellish location that was Wyckford Commons (see http://www.livejournal.com/users/napoleonherself/tag/dyckford+commons for the whole mess if you dare), we were a stone's throw from Avon, but still, I believe, technically in Indy proper.
<P>That's another thing that weirds me out. Is it one city, or is it a bunch? Make up your minds, people!

<P>Jeez. Stay away from Chicago, then.
<P>&gt; Southport, now.
<P>Ah.
<P>&gt; Back at the hellish location that was Wyckford Commons
<BR>> (see http://www.livejournal.com/users/napoleonherself/tag/dyckford+commons
<BR>> for the whole mess if you dare),
<P>Jeez again. That sounds really ... nice. And here I thought living on Fall Creek Parkway and hearing occasional small arms fire across the water was bad.
<P>Napoleon, my dear, there is more than one reason why I left Indiana. White trash pisses me off. Puerto Rican trash is at least somewhat exotic and the weather is better.
<P>&gt; That's another thing that weirds me out. Is it one city, or is it a bunch?
<BR>> Make up your minds, people!
<P>What, you've never been to Orange County?
<P>My favorite is Speedway, Indiana, which is a separate town completely surrounded by Indianapolis. In exactly the same way in which Vatican City is surrounded by Rome. Just as the Roman Catholic Church is thus not actually in Rome, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is not actually in Indianapolis.
<P>Your daily Indiana trivia, and I'm sure you really wanted to know.
<P>It's nice to hear from you. Don't be a stranger.

<P>That, at least, has the decency to be a county, not a city that eats other cities for breakfast.

<P>Well, but after Indianapolis ate Marion County, it realized it was still hungry.
