<P>Cast: Jackson Beck (Howard), Ian Martin (Gerald), Ralph Bell and Bill Quinn (The Maintenance Men)
<P>Synopsis: A study of the art of tape editing is presented through a conversation between two talking tape players. Howard, a veteran tapeplayer, explains the ropes to new machine Gerald. Highlights include examples of how to re-edit conversations for clarity (removing stuttering and pauses), &quot;Tea for Two&quot; re-orchestrated for the tape player, and a re-mixed version of &quot;I Could Have Danced All Night&quot; from &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot; A fine opportunity for Jackson Beck and Ian Martin to have fun in rather atypical roles.
<P>Notes: The closing announcement features a plug for the proposed show for the next week, &quot;a satiric fantasy written by and starring Stan Freberg, about the entertainment competition in a desert spa roughly paralleling Las Vegas.&quot; This program never aired on &quot;The CBS Radio Workshop,&quot; but instead became the center-piece of the premiere episode of the short-lived &quot;Stan Freberg Show.&quot; The resulting sketch was titled &quot;Incident at Los Varoces.&quot;

<P>wow...aldous huxley narrating &quot;brave new world&quot; - and everthing from science fiction to shakespeare to talking tape recorders. hard to believe something like that died - but maybe that was the problem - too much variety, and some of it too challenging. i've caught a few bits of radio drama (primarily on pbs), including &quot;selected shorts&quot;, which is probably the only thing even remotely comparible in terms of the variety - but less and less as time goes on, so one almost forgets how good a radio show can be.
<P>*sigh* - emsworth, you can be a cruel man sometimes, to remind us of what is lost...unless there is still a place one can hear these things?

<BR>> good a radio show can be.
<P>Ilove a quote from Hans Conried regarding the end of the era (and &quot;CBS Radio Workshop&quot; was one of the last dramatic efforts in that area. the last comedies died out or moved to television by 1957, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; ended in 1961, &quot;Suspense&quot; in 1962, and the hardiest of them all, the soaps, all died between 1957 and 1960): &quot;Wouldn't it be wonderful if radio was coming in and television was going out?&quot; Numerous factors contributed to the death of radio drama, of course. The increased sales and popularity of television was naturally a major factor. Moreover, the major networks (CBS and NBC especially, as ABC came as radio was dying out and so was never a major factor) chose to sink their money and talent into television rather than radio, especially as advertisers were in love with it, since they reasoned that visual ads would be twice as effective. That &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; lasted through the early years of the TV version was a miracle and a testament to the high regard that critics, listeneres, and execs alike had for the show. Furthermore, what was left of radio was turned over to the disc jockeys, the increasingly more banal or even crude descendents of &quot;Don McNeill's Breakfast Club,&quot; and eventually the modern talk show host. These programs were much cheaper, with fewer personnel involved and much less creative energy required. A few attempts to revive radio drama in the US (note that it has always thrived on the BBC), such as Himan Brown's &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater,&quot; a sort of follow up to his own famous &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; (complete with creaking door) which ran a surprisingly respectable 8 years (1974-1982) and was rebroadcast with new openings nationally around 1997, suffered from affiliates who would delay the show for sports or drop it at random, and so lack of consistent time slots or sponsors or budgets (Mystery Theater, a 52 minute show, had a budget of $350, which is why the scripts were more often by old time performers or even announcers who loved the medium so much they would work cheap, rather than accomplished playwrights or even the better TV scripters.) NPR, in some regions at least, has kept it going off and on (never in El Paso, alas), and regional shows such as Seattle producer Jim French's &quot;Adventures of Harry Nile&quot; and &quot;Imagination Theater&quot; often air in syndication on local network affilliates on weekends. And KNX 1070 has had its nightly drama hour for several years now (http://www.knx1070.com/program/drama.html). Still, despite such noble attempts, radio as such is but a mere shell of its former self (and as television gets worse and worse, even the likes of &quot;It Pays to Be Ignorant&quot; or the infamous Frank and Anne Hummert sopa operas [noted for the tedious device of having cast members constantly repeat each others names, even full names, and sometimes even occupations, and other key plot points, in case listeners became confused about who was speaking or had short attention spans and needed to have everything hammered over and over again...] seem far more intellectually stimulating and engaging.)
<P>&gt;*sigh* - emsworth, you can be a cruel man sometimes, to remind us of what
<BR>> is lost...unless there is still a place one can hear these things?
<P>Ahem! My dear mouse, you should know by now that I am nothing if not resourceful. Scifi.com, in another wonderful if short-lived experiment, started &quot;Seeing Ear Theater,&quot; producing new audio science fiction and fantasy dramas, as well as author readings and even weekly classic rebroadcasts from &quot;Superman&quot; to &quot;Dimension X.&quot; Most have long disappeared into the ether,&quot; but in addition to the core &quot;Seeing Ear Theater&quot; dramas, an audio version of &quot;Tales from the Crypt,&quot; and J. Michael Straczynski's &quot;City of Dreams,&quot; a handful of classic shows were kept on the server permanently, and can be heard through real audio. These include, in addition to several great Orson Welles broadcasts, two CBS Radio Workshop two-parters, notably &quot;Brave New World!&quot; Streaming real audio, but still worth a listen: http://www.scifi.com/set/playhouse/brave/
<P>The page also has a link to the two part adaptation of &quot;Space Merchants&quot; from teh same series, as well as some fine &quot;Dimension X&quot; and &quot;X-Minus One&quot; broadcasts.
<P>RadioSpirits.com may still have a couple of individual tapes of the series left, though the few they have released are usually only available in the over-priced gift sets. Jerry Haendiges, a noted radio collector, sells custom tapes and CDS to fellow collectors/fans only, and has most of the series: http://members.aol.com/radiolog2/logc1011.html
<P>Finally, found that I still had bookmarked on &quot;My Favorites&quot; the RA version of Radio Spirits' &quot;Radio Hall of Fame,&quot; for broadcast on local stations. This particular set includes an episode of &quot;Escape&quot; starring Van Heflin, William Conrad, and Betty Lou Gerson (voice of Cruella DeVil in the classic 101 Dalmatians), a &quot;Father Know's Best&quot; episode (yes, it began on radio), and if you skip to the end of the file, the &quot;CBS Radio Workshop&quot; episode &quot;I Have Three Heads,&quot; featuring the talking tape cassette players! http://www.mediabay.com/play.asp?clip=4984&amp;player_type=real
<P>So enjoy, my dear mouse!
<P>(P. S. In the unlikely event that you do file sharing on WinMX, look for &quot;Lord_Emsworth902.&quot; Though I prefer to buy tapes or listen to them online, sometimes file sharing of mp3s have been the only way to obtain certain broadcasts. I have a fair portion of the run, including a few not listed in that log because I haven't had a chance to listen to the broadcast or at least the credits yet; notably, &quot;Noh Plays of Japan&quot; and &quot;Portrait of London,&quot; conceived and narrated by Winston Churchill's daughter Sarah.)

<P>Well, were you able to listen to the broadcasts? How did you enjoy them? Also, if your machine has a standard Windows Media Player or WinAmp, it can play mp3s just as easily as it can play wavs and so forth. Don't worry about filesharing. If you have an FTP client, you can download them directly from the Voicechasers webspace (webmaster Kristy is letting me upload old radio shows to it.) Right now, Stan Freberg's &quot;Analysis of Satire&quot; is up, and &quot;An Interview with Shakespeare&quot; is uploading as we speak. If you can't get into the FTP space, direct linking has been temporarily re-enabled, so try the following:
<P>www.voicechasers.com/FrebergAnalysis.mp3 www.voicechasers.com/Shakespeare.mp3
<P>More to be added, gradually. If there's a show you're particularly interested in, let me know.
<P>Also, a Lux Radio Theater version of Disney's Peter Pan and an episode of the adventure anthology &quot;Escape,&quot; &quot;Most Dangerous Game&quot; starring Paul Frees and Hans Conried, are also available:
<P>www.voicechasers.com/LuxPeterPan.mp3 www.voicechasers.com/DangerousGame.mp3
<P>Let me know if you have any problems, and also what you think of the shows when you have time to listen to them.
