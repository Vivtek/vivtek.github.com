<strong>Re: Kudos!</strong>
<P>personally i am on the edge of my seat (which is going to get real uncomfortable over thanksgiving). does this mean there are no free-living piles of garbage by the kremlin, as there are in the U.S. of A.? no ditches, dips or convenient alleyways? and what does this say about our respective ways of life? are commies better because they are neater? or are they merely handicapped by the lack of features in their environment? (this could be the true explanation of the collapse of communism - neither reagan nor afghanistan, but mental decay due to lack of stimuli in the habitat.) and what does this portend for officer obie? (i was really curious to see who got to play him)
<P>(or, i could be reading _way_ to much into this.)

<strong>The epic of Napoleon</strong>
<P>I'm trying to picture Napoleon riding in on horseback and trying to muscle a large picture window out of a saddlebag.
<P>(scene opens: tall, lanky man in a black ill-fitting wild-west style suit stands over an older lady in dress/petticoats tied to a railroad)
<P>* Evil Land Baron: (twirling waxy moustache) Nyar! AND NOW, Widow Humphries! Sell me your ranch at somewhat-below fair market value or NYAR! face the dire concequences. DIRE CONCEQUENCES I SAY! Nyar! * Widow Humphries: (kicking helplessly) Oh, you evil, evil man! If only there were someone who could save me! * ELB: (Pauses, looks around nervously) Well... apparently there's not. NYAR! * WH: (stops kicking... looks around) WAIT, Napeoleon will save me! (Napoleon enters stage left on horseback. Large picture window in saddlebag) * N: STOP YOU FOUL FIEND! You back-stabbing, horse-stealing, card-cheating, land-grubbing, horribly-reeking monster! * ELB: Now, I hardly think all that is necessary, Nyar. * WH: Well, you could /bathe/ more often. And you did once steal that... * N: SILENCE! Fear not, Elderly Widow Humphries! I shall save you by defenestrating this evil cur. * ELB: Evil what? * WH: Wait, elderly!? Now see here... * N: (struggles to get fairly large picture window out of saddle bags) A moment, dastardly louse. * ELB: Nyar! Did she just call me a louse? * WH: And a cur, which means dog. See? A dog and a flea! * ELB: Oh. I see, witty. Do you.. uh, need any help? * N: (grunts, pulling on window) noo... these windows just keep getting bigger. And when you have double panes.. well, they get to be a bit weighty. * ELB: I see.... You know, not to rush this, but there is a train on the way. I'd really not planned on killing the widow here. (accent noticibly gone) * WH: Really? That's so sweet! * ELB: Well, I'm EVIL not .. well, really evil. * N: (Finally works window out of saddlebags and positions it on the ground). THERE! Whew! I'm a bit winded. Give me a moment. * ELB: Wow.. that thing's huge. Uh, look. I'm just going to let her go and.. oh, I don't know... woo her or something. * WH: Oh, you big softy. * N: Now LOOK. I've finally gotten this thing in place, and you WILL BE DEFENESTRATED. Understand!? * ELB: Uh, shouldn't that be higher up? I mean the glass might hurt, but It's right on the ground and all. Shouldn't there be a bit of a fall? * N: Have you any idea how much time it would take to drag this thing up a hill? It must weigh 80 pounds!! * ELB: I see (train whistle in distance) Look, I'm going to untie Ms. Humphries here, and I'll be right with you. * N: OH.. yes, that might be good.

<P>&gt; &quot;Summer&quot; in Hungarian. The ELB is unhappy that autumn has
<BR>> arrived.
<P>And if he lived here he'd be complaining about the occasional and quite typical &quot;early&quot; frost (weather's quite temperate today, though more snow's expected by Sunday, of course.)
<P>Given how muggy summers tend to be here, I always await autumns with unconcealed impatience. (All 4 days of actual autumn we get, that is.) Just goes to show how evil, (dis?)ingenuous protestations to the contrary, ELB is. (Napoleon and an ELB. Napoleon, ELB, a. Napoleon, ELBa. Hrm... that does remind me of something.)

<strong>The further epic of Napoleon.....</strong>
<P>[sounds of galloping hooves, gunshots, and breaking glass]
<P>Announcer: &quot;Around Dodge City and in the territory out west, there's just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers… and that's with a megalomaniac and the sight of…
<P>PANE CLOUDS!
<P>[cue theme, dominated by sleepy guitar strings and accordions]
<P>Deputy Chris: My, it sure is peaceful out here tonight, Miz Napoleon.
<P>Napoleon: Not quite, Christer. Note those wolverines howling in the distance.
<P>Chris: That's true. Prob'ly found some edible vultures or something.
<P>Napoleon: Probably. Well, let's head back into town.
<P>[horse hooves gallop at a respectable pace]
<P>Napoleon: Well, let's just step into the jail house and rustle up some cheese and… well, what have we here…Cyrus Meeker…
<P>Cyrus (in a surly tone): Hello, Chancellor. Just thought I'd drop by, to let you know I was back in town.
<P>Napoleon: I've been waiting for this, Meekr. I know you were involved in that stolen spackle shipment…
<P>Cyrus: Mebbe I was, but there's nuthin you can do about it, Napoleon!
<P>[sound of sudden glass breaking]
<P>Chris: He went out the winder, Miz Napoleon!
<P>Napoleon: YAY! Er… How dare he usurp my legal defenestration authority! After him, Chris! Through the other window!
<P>[sounds of more shattering glass]
<P>Announcer: We'll return to &quot;Pane Clouds,&quot; in just a moment. But first, a word about Daggett and Myers Rolled Ants. Folks, these are the finest, cleanest smoking insects available on the market today. Their toasted antennae provide a unique richness of flavor which you cannot get with any of those generic brand arthropods. So smoke some D &amp; M ants today! We now return to &quot;Pane Clouds.&quot;
<P>Napoleon: Let's see if he went in Doc's office, Chris.
<P>[sounds of fottsteps on staircase]
<P>Chris: Land's sake, those new French windows Doc got for his second floor office sure are nice!
<P>Napoleon: Well, he can afford it, Chris, from the sale of all that medicinal gum and sap. Let's knock and see if Doc's in.
<P>Doc: Well, Nap! Quite a surprise. Anything the matter?
<P>Napoleon: Doc, have you had any new patients lately?
<P>Doc: Now, Nap, I can't break my Hippocratic oath. You know all about doctor/patient confidentiality!
<P>Napoleon: I hate to do this, Doc, but I need you to tell me!
<P>Doc: Keep away from them glass apertures, Nap! They cost over 200 dollars, shipped from Abi---LEEEE!
<P>[sounds of more glass breaking]
<P>Chris: Look, Miz Napoleon! Where Doc landed! It's Meeker! But he's crawling out! We can't reach him in time!
<P>Napoleon! Sure we will, Chris. *emits a distinct, low whistle*
<P>[sound of galloping paws, followed by cheerful growls and screams of anguish]
<P>Chris: Why, lookee there! The wolverines have caught the sidwinder, and are gnawing at his spurs right now!
<P>Napoleon: Only goes to show one thing, Chris. The West is the final sanctuary for one of nature's most wonderous creatures.
<P>[dramatic sting, and out]

<P>I wasn't, but he probably has used &quot;garn&quot; at some point, considering how many of hsi characters tend to use Cockney expressions, or variations on them. Somehow I suspect it was probably said by Nobby Nobbs or Gaspode, though.

<strong>Garn - The Making of an Epic</strong>
<P>&gt; Foul Old Ron. That's it. He says &quot;Garn.&quot; I think.
<P>No, no, no.
<P>The reason it sounds familiar to you is because Garn is the name of a series of books written in the late 1960's about a magical realm set on an indeterminate planet. It's your basic hero quest series, complete with rescue of innumerable helpless damsels, even one trapped in a tower. Though he uses magic to get her down rather than climbing up her hair. It's also got a familiar in the form of a half grown dragon who provides comic relief by screwing stuff up all the time. Pretty standard fantasy fare. There were at least four of them that I know of: Garn: A World in Turmoil, Garn: The Revolution Begins, Garn: The Apple of Innocence, and Garn: The Silver Wolverine.
<P>Okay. I did actually make that up. But did I sound almost as knowledgable as Emsy for a moment there? I almost fooled myself. But then, I'm gullible.

<P>The Scene: A darkened office. Pair of men's legs visible propped up on desk.
<P>Voice Overcut of Detective Holmes: It was a long, dirty night in a long, dirty town.
<P>Office door opens. Enter tall, lean bombshell in evening dress, covered in filth.

<P>Dame: Can you help me, Mr. Holmes? I seem to have pulled a stitch here...
<P>Dame pulls at dress, revealing edge of string. Holmes crosses to her, attempts to assist.
<P>Holmes: That's quite a thread you've got going there, Ma'am.
<P>Dame: I know! I keep trying to cut it, but it pops back out.
<P>Holmes (inspecting the dress): Well, here's your problem, Ma'am.
<P>Camera swings around to reveal wolverine sized paw print on woman's dress.
<P>Dame (embarrassed, clearly guilty): Oh! How do you suppose...?
<P>Holmes: You don't fool me with your innocent act, Missy.
<P>Dame (staring, starting to back away): What? Why, whatever do you mean?
<P>Holmes: You think we don't notice things here in the States? Shall we just skip the fast talk, Mother Mao?
<P>Dame (pulling a gun): Okay, okay. So you sniffed me out, bub. Just stay where you are and no wolverines will get hurt. (starts rifling his desk)
<P>Holmes: Looking for anything in particular?
<P>Dame (snaps at him, flustered): You know damn well what I'm after. Now where is it? Where's the passport for the Hungarian Ape?
<P>Holmes: Somewhere you'll never find it.
<P>Holmes lunges forward, struggle for the gun, wrestles it away from her.
<P>Mother Mao (shattered): Okay! You win.
<P>Holmes (gesturing with the gun): Okay, Mother Mao, lets see those wolverines.

<P>I was thinking of Wolverine from the X-Men comic and film, and having at one time been a fan of the comic books, was mixing a certain dislike of movie adaptation (not that the best such are anything less than successful) with a newfound relative dislike of the original itself, I suppose... not the best combination from which I should have been attempting to &quot;objectively&quot; judge anything: too many biases, far too many prejudices. I've only seen part of that film anyhow.
<P>I don't read any, erm, offline comics on any regular basis now anyhow... sigh... when I do go to the comics shop I tend to look for Jeff Smith's BONE (and related) and occasionally for Thunderbolts. Sometimes other things. (Though I did buy an issue of one of the X-Men titles in the last year or two, if memory serves. Perhaps even two. *chuckle*)

<strong>Re: The epic of Napoleon</strong>
<P>&gt; So have I, and quite recently. I'm thinking Pratchett.
<P>Garn? Doesn't sound familiar, but it's been a while since I've read some of his Discworld novels or the early novel &quot;Strata&quot;, a long while (well, not so long, but late '99 I think, which is when I was introduced to his books in the first place) since I've read the collaboration Good Omens, and some of his novels I've never read at all. Think I've read all the Discworld novels (not the short stories iirc) though. (On the other hand, I recently while waiting for Last Hero- his latest- to come to the local library - went through quite a number of Pratchett's novels and read them for at least the second time. Since I'm very much not a good first-time reader, and find that it's my second read of a novel that's often my first &quot;real&quot; one, this was generally a wonderful experience. Your mileage (adjust for local units) may vary, etc.)

<strong>Re: superheros</strong>
<P>&gt; alright - enough with the vague references already! i demand a full
<BR>> bibliography, _with_ footnotes.
<P>We were referring to a certain Sgt. Angua, who features in several novels in Terry Pratchett's &quot;Discworld&quot; series of satirical fantasy books. While not entirely certain, especially as I don't seem to have the book handy at present, I believe Eric was referring to a scene from Men at Arms (1996). Not to be too spoilerish, but Sgt. Angua represents a minority group in the watch, one which is usually associated with Universal horror films from the 40's, and as part of Ankh-Morpork's city watch, she occassionally finds herself in, ahem, hairy predicaments. (A slightly similar incident in The Truth comes to mind, but hardly involving silver.) I've been enjoying Pratchett quite a bit in recent months, and particularly those novels featuring The Watch, which amusingly combine the basic structures of the police procedural with traditional fantasy motifs and characters, and the occasional touch of film noir (and, of course, as with most Pratchett works, a certain amount of enjoyably bad puns and cultural references.)

<P>macaronic-- 1. Used to designate a burlesque form of verse in which vernacular words are introduced into a Latin context with Latin connotations and in Latin constructions; Also applied to similar verse of which the basis is Greek instead of Latin; and [and this is the sense in which M.

<P>(well, reliable in a very -particular- sense. If you wanted a building you were best off asking for a tea set, to paraphrase... etc. Glad you were able to make some use of his talents, and is that an organ I hear? Appropriate. We've always needed one for the PAFTWJ!)

<P>acutally, there's a more reliable test than that. salt water is denser than fresh water, so if you throw her into the pool: if she sinks, she's salt-water, if she floats, she's freshwater. umm...._you're_ closer to the door - why don't you just quick toss her in? i'll hold otu for you (him's just a snuggle-bear, isn't him?)

<P>How about we compromise?
<P>I'll ask this glass of fresh water what the square of 4 is.
<P>Then I'll ask Fenny. If Fenny knows, then she's smarter than the fresh water, hence less dense than fresh water, hence fresh water. And I don't have to go have robotic arms put on to replace the old ones she 'helped' me with.

<strong>Re: Wolverine petting privileges for everyone!</strong>
<P>&gt; *chuckle* You noticed I responded to that post at 2 am too, hrm?
<P>&gt; Actually, my sleep schedule has gone to (expletive deleted) lately, for a
<BR>> long list of reasons. But largely it's a matter of sleeping, waking up,
<BR>> doing something on the computer (which is generally already on and running
<BR>> a SETI@home process anyway), and going back to sleep, so more interrupted
<BR>> sleep than lack of. Depends.
<P>&gt; I'm not so sure I'm making sense to myself sometimes; it's certainly not
<BR>> just you. I certainly improvise a lot.
<P>&gt; I -certainly- do a lot of the-equivalent-of vaudeville routine posts, or
<BR>> so my brain sees them...
<P>Well, Vaudeville was a wonderful institution, after all. Nothing wrong with a good cross-talk act, after all, especially a knock-about one, with or without green whiskers.
<P>&gt; So this -is- a good thing? Dubious-:)
<P>Come now! You are unfamiliar with the expression that &quot;Life is just a pack of wolverines?&quot; Fenny's been satiated with a folding table, if that's any comfort. And little Otu's just waiting for someone to pet or hold him.

<P>There is a WORD for this? People, I am really not used to other people knowing things I don't, and yet on this forum it happens with astonishing regularity. I knew that in multilingual communities (which are not particularly stable, linguistically speaking; they tend to go for one or the other language or to settle into a creole after a generation) it can sometimes happen that mixing the languages in creative ways can be taken as a sign of virtuosity -- I didn't know that the English did this and named it, even.

<P>Such as the &quot;Spanglish&quot; which is commonly spoken in the Texas border region (I'm still mildly surprised that people actually use &quot;caque&quot; instead of &quot;pastel&quot; regarding that ever popular baked desert.)
<P>&gt;it can

<P>Well, actually, it was the Italians that started it (Yes, Pokey, we know how you feel about them.) The 16th century Italian poet Teofilo Floengo (also known as &quot;Merlinus Cocaius&quot; or &quot;Merlin Cocalo,&quot; pen names), wrote a poem combining common Italian with Latin. The poem was titled Liber Macaronices, and he coined the term macaronic to describe such a usage. Apparently the English didn't adopt the word until a century later (at which point they expanded the definition to apply to the mingling of any two or more languages in verse.) It also seems to have been around this point that English writers and poets gradually began to use the macaronic style, though I'd probably need to do more research before finding any concrete examples of this, or at least the names of noted practitioners.
<BR>> Ten points to Eric.

<strong>Re: superheros</strong>
<P>&gt; alright - enough with the vague references already! i demand a full
<BR>> bibliography, _with_ footnotes.
<P>Well, I can only tell you what -I- meant...
<P>Seriously spoilery things to the novels of Terry Pratchett ahead. The reader may consider self duly warned?
<P>I was referring to a scene in the novel &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; in which a prominent character (Delphine Angua von Uberwald), a member of the Watch, needs to rescue a fellow Watchman (Cheri) who is, at the moment, hanging from a chandelier over a very hot vat of candle wax. (I'm remembering this, though the book is in the other room; I really should check for accuracy.) Other members of the Watch are there- the reason Angua (the name she goes by in the city) is the only Watchman who _can_ rescue Cheri is reasonably simple. Angua is a werewolf.
<P>Cheri, by the by: doesn't know this; can't stand werewolves; believes her brother was killed by one; is wearing a silver (-coated?) chainmail vest to defend herself against same; ...
<P>Angua knows this about Cheri (except perhaps about the vest...) but (asking people to look away, for reasons perhaps understandable to readers of the earlier &quot;Men at Arms&quot;) changes to wolf, jumps up, rescues Cheri... causing her considerable burning (it'll heal, but it's painful,) causing Cheri considerable astonishment (the Watch commander's assessment: 'look at it this way- if she hadn't been a werewolf, you would now be the world's biggest novelty candle' (or words to that effect)) and - etc.
<P>Very indirectly the situation you described put me in mind of that; but then I have an indirect, associative, given-to-odd-tangents mind in -any- event.
<P>Wonderful novel (one of my favorites) in a wonderful (imhonesto- an expression I do not, like some, take to mean, that if you disagree with me there is something wrong with -you- - rather a favorite gripe, to think of it, of Pratchett's, when it comes to how &quot;imho&quot; is used...) series... and I hope that I have not spoiled too much if anyone should decide to take a look after all.

<P>um.....i thought the new strip _posed_ all those questions.......
<P>&gt; In fact, that's answered some questions that have been nagging at the back

<P>huh? when did the hamsters get in? are we in another strange time-loop?
