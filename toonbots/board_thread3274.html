<P>When I said I need never see a movie again, I forgoe to qualify that with &quot;for a few days&quot; -- Jimmy Neutron was pretty darned good. I laughed a lot. There are some quotable quotes. &quot;Gee, Jimmy, the last time we tried this we couldn't make it out of the atmosphere.&quot;
<P>Amelie is on here in town; I'm going to try to get over to see it.

<P>Oh. Right. I was in Ohio at that point. Still. You could have popped in and watered the plants and fed the cats.

<P>Feed the cats to the plants, then. Jenn's been in the Jihad for a while now. I'll bet she keeps lots of really big Venus Flytraps and stuff.

<strong>Cats and Plants and Hats and Ants</strong>
<P>Thank you all /very/ much for your help.
<P>The cats do not need watering, they are more than capable of dancing through the bathtub directly after someone's showered and covering it with dirty little cat paw prints.
<P>But cats are very clean creatures, you say? Not after they've been digging in the plants.
<P>The cats also do not need assistance with the concept of 'eat this plant, it's poisonous'. They even have their own cat grass plant. But they prefer the mystery plant that is probably from the Amazon and filled with toxins.

<P>thus proving that basic principle of cat behavior, 'whatever you think is completely unreasonable and downright pigheaded, i will be more than happy to do' (mine insisted last night that she _loved_ chestnuts, merely because i was occupied in shelling them. she also refuses to drink out of her nice clean bowl; she much prefers the scummy algae-covered one on the patio [in those times when i am not around to turn on the faucet for her])

<P>I suspect this is quite true, though I wouldn't know.
<P>Jenn - sorry about the late reply. I just got a LiveJournal account ( www.livejournal.com/~malver ) and have been so hyper playing with it that I've been rather neglecting my duties to the forum (shame!!!!) ... I've never kept a diary before, despite taking a diary course at BOCES, and it's fun, this sort of electronic journaling even moreso.
<P>The visit with family went very well, saw some wonderful movies, and I'll consider learning some XML beyond the very basic bit I learned from &quot;The Counter.com Professional Edition&quot; at one point ;) - especially if I either have an idea for an ep or get together with others about one. (This is beginning to feel like a combined reply. Sorry.)
<P>Oh, also saw &quot;The Business of Strangers.&quot; Not as good as Amelie, I thought, but rather good, disturbing, well-acted...

<P>they give courses on keeping diaries? - i've kept one for years (although i have always preferred to call them 'journals' - 'diary' always reminds me of the little-girl ones, with the strap and lock to keep it closed) - just sorta any-old-how (which doubtless means i've lost my chance to be this generation's pepys - although since i have no connection to anyone of the least importance, i was unlikely to manage that anyway (also my handwriting seems to constitute its own secret code))

<P>Sigh... just because you can take a course in all the very different, fascinating, ways of achieving various goals (and indeed the different goals that can be achieved by journaling, by keeping a diary... so, the different ends, and the different means to the end...) - that's not the same, at all, as saying that one's taking the course as: certification, without which, one is not a Recognized Journalist (pun intended... and since I'm keeping mine at the LiveJournal site, I agree and prefer the term Journal too...)
<P>And as a person who works as the Meeting Secretary of a Network Integration company which employs a number of Systems Engineers I have some notion what _can_ be meant by &quot;Certification,&quot; after all *chuckle* (great, I'm just setting myself up to be kidnapped *g* )
<P>To set down my gist rather more briefly: it was a very fine, well-taught (I took it in part for the teacher, it was not my first course with that teacher) course in the ways diaries/journals have been kept, not a course one passes through to be taken seriously as a taker of them.
<P>I have a ways to go before I will have learnt how to be clear or concise...
<P>Best regards!

<P>this is what you get talking to a technically oriented person - we immediately think 'how to'. and actually i should have known better - i started my current bout of journal keeping because i read such a thing was good to sort of internally work out problems one encountered in the world - so i started to keep myself from assaulting my boss (who was actually quite a good guy when he wasn't being a total jerk) (and who was also _much_ bigger than me - mouse's 1st rule of self-defense: never attack anyone who can pound you into the ground)
<P>&gt; And as a person who works as the Meeting Secretary of a Network

<P>hey - i know any number of engineers who are certifiable.
