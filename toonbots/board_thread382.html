<P>Well, I wasn't going to say anything, but agreed. The last big break was six days, and now five days. First you add a new Toonbot consecutively for about five days in a row, so we become even more hooked. And then you slow down your schedule. I've found myself irrationally checking here every time I'v been online, just in case anything other than the disembodied heads of the Bard and Mao-Tsetung are sitting there. Now, of course, you know I don't mean o give offence. We realize how busy you are, and also that you've been wanting to wait until you add some new features, at this point, I'm sure some of us would take anything! I can't believe I've reached this point, where I compulsively check this site everyday, and the Bard and Chairman Mao are sitting there, watching me, there eyes boring holes into my very soul and examining the inner cavity which reflects the ultimate futility of my existance as the entire world slowly collapses upon my ears with an ever increasing crescendo, reaching higher and higher, as my need for a Toonbot to bring some order from the chaos increases, and suddenly I note the very stillness in the house and yet my head begins throbbing and throbbing and throbbing and throbbing and throbbing and ............................................................;' /lushnb rtqws;c v'zdxl?

<P>My God, Emsworth, that has to be the funniest thing I've read in my life.
<P>Well, I have the Toon-o-Matic in pieces on the garage floor and damned if I can figure out where this sprocket came from. But by golly, for my long-suffering fanbase I will have a new toon today.

<P>There *is* no regular schedule! MWAhahahahhahahaaaaaa! I'm going to update twice daily for a while, then I'll wait for ten days to see if I can get Lord Emsworth to pop a vein again. It's all part of the psychological studies that are Toonbots' main source of funding.
<P>Seriously -- for the past week, I've spent between 3 and 5 hours a day cleaning and repairing our rental house. My wife said she doesn't care who moves in next as long as they're not barnyard animals again. It took about four hours to scrub the kitchen floor. I've seen cleaner bus terminals. Let's not discuss the condition of the stove. Or the interesting entomological studies we were privileged to perform (thank God for competent exterminators.) Or the missing glass from the back door, or the garage door we'll have to replace, or the fourth-inch of accumulated gunk in the washer/dryer area (oven cleaner worked wonders on that -- lipids are lipids, apparently).
<P>So, none the worse for some honest proletarian work (long live Chairman Mao and the Cultural Revolution!), here I am again. New toon in progress.
