<strong><a href="mailto:eidegoo@plasticspork.com">Jenn</a></strong> <i>Tue Jul 31 12:26:40 2001</i><br>
<strong>Archive perusing</strong>
<P>I finally finished reading the archives today. (That's right, I have no school and my work consists of...reading archive pages. Seriously.)
<P>Prolific! I'm now severely dejected cause it seems that every single thing I said, has already /been/ said. And commented on. Twice. The thing is...I wonder if that makes me conformist, even though I didn't know it had already been said? Or if I'm merely a conformist in my soul and not in my outward actions. My father once had a week long depression because he said he'd never had an original thought and I thought he was quite silly. (I was a teenager at the time and /everything/ my parents did was quite silly) But I think I know how he feels. Ah, well. I might not be original, but I sure am enthusiastic.
<P>I did have something to say...I've been keeping a little running log, and I think I've come up with the four sure ways to make a thread go on way past it's time.
<P>a) Say anything about anyone defenestrating anything.
<P>b) Say anything about old cartoons or theme songs.
<P>c) Say anything that confuses Jenn and has to do with computer code, Perl, or some kind of computer like question. Thingie.
<P>d) Mention the fact that anyone is slipping on the # of posts count.
<P>So! I don't really know enough to talk about how cool the code is. However, I can quote the husband. Heow says, 'Heh. That's really clever, actually.' and 'He must be using Linux. Only a masochist would do Perl in Windows.' (this I found incredibly entertaining because I think I understand from one of the posts that Michael does indeed use Windows. I could be wrong. I so often am when it has to do with computers.)
<P>I also suck with old cartoons. And theme songs. Though I do have to say that I did get the theme song to Pole Position stuck in my head, so whoever did that post, (it was sometime this morning and I can't remember who)...thanks. Thanks /so/ much.
<P>I was also troubled by the discussion about Mao's piercing gaze. I'm not bothered by his expression, I think he looks like someone's grandfather in mid 'pull my finger'. I /am/ troubled by the mole.
<P>Now, the most important part of my post, which is why I put it at the bottom! I got my membership card in the mail! Thanks, gopher! I feel so complete now! I'm gonna get it laminated so that the wolverines don't bleed or anything. See if I don't.
<P>Jenn &lt;-- watching the mole's eyes follow her around....

<P>Yes, he does. With ActivePerl, the windows version of ghostscript, the windows version of ImageMagick, and all his slashes in the paths for filenames facing the wrong way. Crazy bastard...

<P>Mother of God! Has the NI (hrm. There's an end to this...it's like Responsible Computing or something like that. My memory is like swiss cheese) heard about this? We might have to set up a barricade around his house to keep his subterranean BASE safe from them!

<P>&gt; Jenn understandable
<P>What you say?
<P>The only NI I can think of right away is NIMH. I suppose that we should probably be worried about them, too.

<P>&gt; The only NI I can think of right away is NIMH. I suppose that we should
<BR>> probably be worried about them, too.
<P>I had to stay an extra hour and a half at work today. This is a /travesty/.
<P>Because of this, I reread the toonbots archives after I finished the forum archives. Then I started on the Pokey the Penguin archives. I think it has tampered with my brain functioning.
<P>I even called Heow for help but he was insanely unhelpful. He got focused on which way Michael does his slashes and couldn't get off of it. Lets just say The National Institute of Making Sure That Slashes Go the Same Way, and have done with it?
<P>I have a very important Pokey related question, though. How come we don't have anything in our Jihad that's possessed by the devil, boxing glove or otherwise? I think this is definately a hole that's waiting to be filled. And no, I'm not volunteering, Tirdun.
<P>Jenn &lt;-- digging a trench around Michael's house as we speak.
<P>(Oh! Don't worry about the NIMH. They can't hurt us cause we're not a danger to ourselves or others. See? I told them the useless degree would come in handy someday!)

<strong>Possession, By the Devil or Otherwise</strong>
<P>I've been thinking about this, actually.
<P>Now that I think about it, it seems like I've seen possession in several venues already.
<P>Sluggy has possession by the constipated ghost of Ayn Rand, and by various demons. Purple Duck Mambo has appliances possessed by the devil. Pokey the Penguin has the possessed boxing glove. Glych had that tricky thing recently with the God and Atom and possession and stuff. And you know...a) I don't read nearly as many comics as I /should/ (just ask Tirdun) and b) my memory tends to crap out on me from time to time. I probably missed someone.
<P>So, here's my *new* thought on the subject:
<P>My own tagline for Toonbots!
<P>Toonbots: Proudly Demonic Possession Free for 8 months!
<P>Jenn
<P>I swear. I'm gonna stop posting now. Right after I overtake Chris.

<P>Oh, /no/! I was rude! I'm sorry! It wasn't so much a /planned/ overtaking as, you know...hey, look! Chris and I are neck and neck! Perhaps I should stop posing nonsense. Well, that and it fulfills one of the necessary items. Okay, it was kind of a multilevel comment. Deeeeeeep. Yeah. That's me. Yup.
<P>&quot;Oh, look! A concrete wall!&quot; *smack* &quot;Ow...&quot;

<P>That explains the broken pottery on the kitchen floor. Sigh. (No, that wasn't meta-damage, either -- my guess is a close lightning strike sometime in July.)
<P>I would like to take this opportunity to say that (1) I'm back (2) I'm actually checking this forum before sleeping and (3) you guys are great.
<P>I just love jetlag going west. It's easy to stay up late, plus for a couple of weeks I'm an early riser. However, it's rather confusing that this morning we took in the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace (except the Queen wasn't there, so there wasn't much to it) and now I'm in my subterranean base in Bloomington ON THE SAME DAY. Weird.
<P>I'd also like to take this opportunity to say that even though Europe has been really hot, it was still cooler than Indiana at midnight. The body forgets.

<P>Gopher's been busy, so he doesn't know that I have forsaken the ActiveState Perl build for a mingw32 build I built myself. (This was chiefly so that I could run Inline::C against a compiler I actually own, the gcc with mingw32.) And he must have been busy since mid-April, because otherwise he'd know that I removed the dependence on Ghostscript when I started writing an intermediate SVG step; the only thing I had to do for *that* was to write some code to parse TTF files for font metrics.
<P>(If that doesn't impress Heow, have one of the cats defenestrate him.)
<P>But yep, it's Windows. Windows and Perl. Windows and a *homemade* Perl. Mwuhahahaha!

<P>See? That.../that/ is the kind of team spirit I like to see!
<P>I /would/ volunteer to be possessed by Chris instead of the devil...
<P>Except that that's easily misinterpreted cause I just realized that post is gonna be further down than this post...oh, the humanity!
<P>And I know *someone's* gonna call me on it.
<P>Btw...Chris, did you notice we posted at exactly the same time? Separated at birth!
