<strong>Fortunes of humble self....</strong>
<P>...like parked car started in wrong gear... completely reversed!
<P>And I mean that in the most positive sense! Syracuse called up today. Someone *else* dropped out, so the letter offering me a full teaching assistantship ($12,460 stipend, tuition for 24 credit hours, fees included) will be on my doorstep tomorroat at 10am.
<P>So Jenn, better start your housecleaning! Not sure when we'll be getting up to Syracuse, as Arkansas trip has already been planned, but it has to be soon, obviously. mouse, we'll see, but there's a good chance I may have to bail on Comic-Con, I'm afraid. Still, gives us all the more time to plan a full Jihad reunion for 2006, eh?

<P>Syracuse, home of Fluble.
<P>Congratulations, Emsworth!! Definitely some good news to hear.

<P>No, but you can e-mail me, if you remember to, with the info! I should have a nice phonecard thingie, which should help.
<P>Of course, at this point biggest kicker is whether we can find single apartment housing close enough to campus (I won't have a car).
<P>Oh, and just to settle something, Jenn, my sister talked about possibly coming to visit and us both going to see a Broadway show. A) Do you know anything about how prices fluctuate and b) are muggers as common as she seems to think?

<P>&gt; No, but you can e-mail me,
<P>Lookit that! Email! Right there!
<P>&gt; Oh, and just to settle something, Jenn, my sister talked about possibly
<BR>> coming to visit and us both going to see a Broadway show. A) Do you know
<BR>> anything about how prices fluctuate and b) are muggers as common as she
<BR>> seems to think?
<P>Oh. Sorry about this. You've hit on one of my favorite topics: How NYC Is NOT The Same As It Was In 1970.
<P>NYC was a seething cesspool in the 70's, I'll freely admit. Garbage on the streets, prostitution all over, riots for the fun of it. Unfortunately, a lot of people visited in the 70's, went home and proceeded to tell the rest of the nation about it. Since then, we had a little thing called 'Mayor Guliardi (I can't spell his name)'. Mayor G cleaned up the city. He moved prostitution and drug dealing out of Times Square. He instituted regular garbage pickups. He poisoned all the darling little rat babies. He also created a fascist and totalitarian police force, but hey. Noone's perfect.
<P>So after my little speech there...answers to your questions.
<P>a) Depends largely on which show you want to see. There are half price tickets available on shows that aren't ragingly popular just now, just around the corner from me. These will generally run you around $60 a pop.
<P>b) Is she planning on going to really bad areas of town? Because NYC is so heavily dependent on tourism, the tourist areas of town have a very impressive police presence. Now, if she heads out to the boroughs, to the bad areas out there...she might have a problem. Though, I worked in those bad areas for 8 months and never even felt threatened. I've lived here for 5 years now and haven't been mugged yet. Do bear in mind that in spite of the fact that it's our biggest city, NYC is not even in the top ten for crime in the nation. Stay in the tourist areas and you'll be fine.
<P>Because I am an amazing host, if I'm not working I will of course drag you lot around the city and keep you out of trouble.

<P>alright, emsworth! i will miss seeing you in july - but i am _really_ happy you got the ta-ship. graduate school is hard enough, trying to do it while also trying to make a living is the road to madness (and taking 10 years to complete your master's).
<P>i keep meaning to send you a check, and then i get home late and don't turn the computer on to get your address (or, as i did last night - _do_ turn the computer on, and discover that adelphia has decided that even though i spent an hour and a half on the phone with them getting cable internet working, i really didn't want it after all...) so i will just not include the extra funds for the comic-con ticket (if it works out later that you _will_ be going, you will have my phone # on the check).
<P>*sigh* and broadway plays....maybe we can arrange a jihad reunion in new york? surely by 2006, i'll have funds for a real vacation...
