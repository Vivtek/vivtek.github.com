<strong>Escaflowne - 9.0</strong>
<P>I suspect I would have liked this one better if the sound level weren't all over the place, but I had to keep it quiet so the loud stuff wouldn't bother my sleeping family, and so half the dialog was basically inaudible.
<P>In retrospect, I should have watched it in Japanese with subtitles. Damn. I just now thought of that. What an idiot I am!
<P>All in all, this appeared to be the usual Japanese fantasy: make up a world with *more* detail than ours, then stuff it into a two-hour vehicle, resulting in sort of a feeling of cotton bursting at the seams. The imagery, of course, was breathtaking. Airships with crow's nests -- I want one of those!
<P>Definitely worth watching, but don't expect to understand it. I don't think comprehensibility was what they were going for.

<P>Possibly just the result of compressing a 26-episode series into a 100-minute movie.

<P>Ah. It's a series. OK, that explains a lot. I should have known. (Yes, I know I'm destroying my geek pop-culture street cred with this post. I'm still the guy who thought of generating cartoons from XML, so I have a lot of karma banked.)

<P>I haven't seen the movie, but the series DOES make sense, within its own little universe at least. But this is all irrelevant to the main point, which is of course that those airships ARE cool, and if you get one I intend to hijack it.

<BR>> know I'm destroying my geek pop-culture street cred with this post. I'm

<P>How much interest is that paying? (Would the interest also apply in reverse, if you used it all up and then some? I wonder what the gods have to say about karmic usury.)

<P>i always figured michael wanted to usury his karmic for interest....after all, it's the humor that draws people in.
