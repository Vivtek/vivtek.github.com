<strong>Dammit, Michael, I knew what the truck said</strong>
<P>The closest approximation of writing the cyrillic form of 'MIR' with a Western keyboard is 'MUP.' In fact the only thing wrong is that a capital U looks as much like the 'TS' character as it does the 'EE' character.
<P>If I didn't know, what sense would the sentence *after* &quot;I like the truck labelled 'MUP'...&quot; make, in my original post?

<strong>Re: Dammit, Michael, I knew what the truck said</strong>
<P>&gt; If I didn't know, what sense would the sentence *after* &quot;I like the
<BR>> truck labelled 'MUP'...&quot; make, in my original post?
<P>I thought you were just being too obscure for me to follow. Expecting people to make sense just isn't in my power. If I had thought about it, I probably would have (eventually) figured out what you meant. Maybe. Yeah. Or maybe I just need more sleep.
<P>But I wanted to do the Coke truck rhyme anyway, so you gave me a fine excuse. Granted, my daughter thought it was pretty stupid when I made it up, but she's only seven and can't be expected to appreciate the fine subtlety of the humor. I thought maybe the Jihad would be cool enough.
<P>So EXCUUUUUUUSE ME!

<strong>Re: Dammit, Michael, I knew what the truck said</strong>
<P>now see, his last sentence made sense to me because _i_ thought he did in fact mean MUP (Multiple Universal naming convention Provider) which sounds a pretty hi-techie thingie to me, and not something that would come in a hand-painted panel truck -- i admit i didn't initially get mir (hey, some days i can barely keep up in _english_, let alone foreign languages using roman-style letters to mean entirely different things) -- but i figured the whole mup/mir thing (with multiple mup definitions) was adding whole new levels of subtle interconnectednessedness (it also stands for metric utilization plan - see the possibilities?).
<P>and turning it into a coke truck on top of everything else (what with mao and lenin being the featured players in this) is even funnier (symbolizing as it does the cokeification of communism, and the overwhelming power of american junk items to dominate world commerce, and in particular as a driving force in opening up the ussr and china for the american market, in contrast to the commies' simplistic efforts to foster globalization in the name of 'mir') (altho i admit the lenin-as-box thing went right over my head)
<P>oh yeah - _boxjam_ is the jerk (see what i mean about barely keeping up).

<P>uhhhhh - Coke or coke? (maybe i _should_ revisit this capitalization thing)
<P>&gt; The rest of this thread went woosh over my head.
<P>_that_ was the noise i heard. this is one of those threads that started somewhere else entirely, and rode of madly in all directions. (you need to start from boxjam's earlier posting down below somewhere)

<P>Now, see? mouse *GETS* Toonbots. (I'd check the Yellow Pages under &quot;Psychiatry&quot; next chance you get, mouse.) This is *exactly* what I meant, in absolutely all seriousness. Well, that and I wanted to use the Coke-truck rhyme.
<P>The Lenin-as-box thing was a mistake. He really did need debugging. But I decided to leave it, because as we all know, improv is a good way to combat burnout, and all the &quot;in&quot; cartoonists are doing improv lately. So I'm practicing my spontaneity.

<P>mup, bup -- they're all funny sounds.
<P>&gt; Now, see? mouse *GETS* Toonbots.
<P>ummm.....thanks? - altho actually at the moment i'm on cold medication - maybe that's it (i mean, that was really just a free-range free-association desperate attempt to look intellegent sort of thingie)
<P>&gt; This is *exactly* what
<BR>> I meant, in absolutely all seriousness.
<P>yeah, right. you just wanted an excuse to use the rhyme, and then _i_ made it seem....well, rational isn't exactly the right word.....
<P>&gt; Well, that and I wanted to use the
<BR>> Coke-truck rhyme.
<P>see! - you admit it!
