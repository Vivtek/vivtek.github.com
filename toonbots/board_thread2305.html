<strong>Baby Wolverine!</strong>
<P>Spurred on by Napoleon's excellent renderings of most of the more senior wolverines...

<P>We finally managed to get little Otu to sleep. Looks quite peaceful, doesn't he (if a tad slanted due to my scanner.)

<strong>Re: Baby Wolverine!</strong>
<P>Okay. /Now/ I'm grumpy.
<P>a) Bank of New York won't let me look at the picture of the baby wolverine.
<P>b) Heow and I, on our glorious adventure through the great Northeast, stumbled upon the Woodman Institute, which I highly recommend should any of you be in Dover, NH. It's a marvellous museum, which, in addition to having a two headed snake and a four legged chicken, has many stuffed animals. Among them, a stuffed wolverine. I made Heow take several pictures of it in the hopes of sharing them with the Jihad members. And now there's (probably. Not like I can see it to be sure) cute pictures of baby wolverines (I'm assuming alive and unstuffed, except maybe for keyboards and mouse's fingers) on the forum /and/ cute drawings of wolverines on the forum.
<P>Were you people reading my mind or something? That would make me feel better, actually. We were decidedly without electronic things while on vacation. The cell phone stopped working as we crossed the Maine border. Heow broke out in a rash in protest. As a side note, however, we had cable in our hotel rooms (remember that like Michael, we don't have cable in the home. Gasp.) and Heow discovered a channel called something like Tech Channel or something. With lots of stuff about computers and stuff. So that helped a little. Course, it mostly meant that he could snort and go 'Yeah, right.' cause it was mostly thinly veiled MS oriented shows. But it was something. He said to me at one point, &quot;I was thinking about making a computer out of tinker toys. The only thing is, it would be really large.&quot; And I knew it was time to come home.

<P>Actually, as hopefully you've discovered by now, the wolverine infant was a mere pen and ink rendering, unfortunately (and a slightly badly scanned one, at that.) As far as stuffed wolverines go, though we'd probably prefer the plush variety, should you care to post any images here, please feel free to do so.
