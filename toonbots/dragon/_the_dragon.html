<p class=MsoNormal><i>This is a little story I wrote in a single swoop in
college, that is, sometime between 1984 and 1988, but probably in 1986.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I wrote it on my Apple ][e and printed it on
a real live dot-matrix printer to show my mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>And it's a good thing I did; I sold the Apple some years later
and the disks are long gone even if I could figure out how to read them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I ran across the paper copy in my mother's
magazine rack in the early 90's and took it home with me to type, filed it, and
forgot about it completely.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Fast-forward to 2006, and we have a dumpster out front
while we replace a bathroom. My wife
instructs me to sort through this old rusty filing cabinet with all the crap in
it, so we can toss the cabinet while we still have the dumpster available.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I find the long-lost ultrasound pics of our
daughter, and this hard copy of my very first story.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I read the story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And it is good. So good I'll
resist editing it at all while typing it, for historical interest if for no
other reason.  Apologies for the odd formatting; I type in Word, and
for various technical reasons, I've been using Word 2000 lately, and it
doesn't render to HTML very well.  I may fix it all up later, but in the
meantime, eh, it's readable.  Live with it.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p><strong>THE DRAGON: Installment the First</strong><br></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The dragon had no name.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>It had once had a name, far in the past, but
it had long since been forgotten. Now
it was simply &quot;the dragon.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Nothing further was necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Over the eons of its slow,
contented life, it had amassed quite a hoard of diverse shiny things: jewels,
gold, pretty rocks; anything that happened to have caught its eye.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>There were two reasons for this: first, it
is any dragon's purpose in life to collect thing; second, no-one really cares
to oppose a dragon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Another thing dragons are noted
for is their magical abilities. This
dragon, no slouch in preserving the status quo, had also collected all manner
of flashy spells – in a word, anything that caught its eye.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Naturally, it hadn't created any of its own;
that is not in a dragon's nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Dragons are collectors, and none too organized in that capacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>This dragon, then, was quite an
average dragon, except for its age – it had been around a very long time, long
enough that it had itself forgotten the exact time of its beginnings.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>And as for the inhabitants of the
surrounding countryside, they considered it a fixture.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>It had been around long before the settling
of the region; perhaps even before its discovery – no-one knew any more.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>It had seen the land develop from untracked
wilderness, to a sleepy rural area, to a thriving net of commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It was a comfortable life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The hours were good, the neighbors
pleasant. The neighbors, in fact, were
quite helpful in fulfilling the dragon's desires regarding collecting.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>They would often bring him nice new objects,
simply asking information in return, for the dragon (naturally) collected
knowledge as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It was a comfortable life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>John Morrison's life, however, was
anything but comfortable. The hours
were impossible, and he tried not to think of the neighbors.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>John was the sole salesman for a rapidly
sinking insurance company. This in
itself should not have been so bad, but for the fact that the only reason he
held this job was to pay for a university education.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>John was working his way through school at a small Midwestern
engineering college, and jobs were few and far between.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Each day after classes, John would
put in five hours (minimum) at the office, then work out for an hour, do some
homework, and collapse into bed for a meager amount of sleep before starting
the cycle over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Needless to say, the pressure of
this boringly repetitive lifestyle was slowly driving him to insanity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>And his neighbors, as I said earlier, were
less than desirable. They had moved in
just a week or two ago, but it seemed like a year.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>At all hours of the night, there were all sorts of sounds coming
from the house, sometime horrendous sounds like the screams of cats, sometimes
just bangs, as from heavy things falling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There were already many rumors flying around about these people.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Some said they were escaped criminals.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Others maintained they were a family of
hereditary psychopaths. Some swore up
and down they were haunted somehow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Some, a small number, but some,
thought they were druids.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They were right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The druids play a pivotal role in
this tale, because they were of a rather experimental nature.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The moment they discovered something
druidic, they had to try it out, often on some unsuspecting soul that
happened to be walking by their humble abode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They had done many strange and horrible things.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>They had done a small number of really neat
and wonderful things. As all knowledge,
druidic knowledge can be used for any purpose, good or evil.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>These druids weren't using it; they were
just trying (rather ineptly) to discover it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At any rate, they were just about
to try another thing that had captured their fickle attention – dimensional
travel. They had recently happened upon
extremely ancient excerpts from books on the subject, and one instruction
booklet for operating a certain druidic item that allowed inter-universal
movement. Unfortunately, they had no
actual theoretical knowledge, and so they had been trying to get the process
right for some time, without astounding success.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>However, as you might guess, they had perfected the knowledge
just before this story begins. And,
also rather predictably, they haphazardly chose our friend John Morrison as
their experimental subject.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>John's life was at least going to
lose its boring repetitiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>So was the dragon's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Thus ends Chapter One, being just over one printed page
of Apple ][e text. The story will
continue when I have more time to type it.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
