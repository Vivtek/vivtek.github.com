<strong>Non-Jihad Wolverine Renderings</strong>
<P>What ho! Recently received a capital color wolverine rendering from a certain Mr. Hunt, Elfwood artist and acquaintance from another forum. He'd like to call this one &quot;Elisabeth,&quot; however (though I thought it bore a resemblance to Guthrie judging from the collar.) Well, enjoy, I hope.

<P>i would have guessed (given the timing) that that was a turkey leg, myself. (figured she was just looking forward to the Day of Licensed Unbridled Gluttony, which must surely be an important date on the wolverine calendar.)

<P>Pardon for not making it clear enough, but Athcu was rendered by Napoleon herself in her usual inimitable style (and as a charming experimentation in color.)

<P>We still haven't finished decorating our tree (still need to test all the lights), though we did manage to get it up on Sunday. Did manage to get my Coca-Cola village up, though, as well as the newest addition to our collection of Christmas decorations... a charming set of Nativity Bears!

<strong>It's that Merry Christmas Time Again</strong>
<P>Ooooh! Lets talk Christmas!
<P>I have boxes and boxes of Christmas stuff, and can decorate with the best of them - Nativity scene, garlands, ribbons, the whole schmeal.
<P>Unfortunately, I also have literally /no/ closet space due to the fact that I live in an apartment that is itself the size of a closet. So all of our Christmas stuff is living in the in-law's basement.
<P>I will instead live vicariously through Tirdun's never relenting AllYearMas lights and Emsy's actual decorating. Do the wolverines help decorate the Jihad clubhouse (yeah, yeah. I know it's actually a high security technologically advanced headquarters. But it's Christmas. Let me pretend to be in the Mouseketeers, huh?)?
<P>I had a wonderful mental image just there of one of Napolean's great pictures with ornaments and that sparkly streamer stuff draped over the wolverine.

<P>nonono - to be christmassy you have to put the wolverines in plush reindeer horns and red noses (if you are extremely daring, you could hand christmas ornaments from the horns).
<P>this could be a great party game - 'decorate the wolverine' - lots of running and screaming, sure to help build appetites for christmas dinner (and make the blessing that much more heartfelt).

<strong>Re: It's that Merry Christmas Time Again</strong>
<P>You know...one of the things that's really nice about this forum is that practically everything I ask for, I get. Well, that part about just asking to be defenestrated and then being defenestrated isn't as cool as wolverine pictures, but still.
<P>Yay! What a cute picture! Did you do that, Emsy?
<P>&gt; ::wolverines gnaw on mouse ears::
<P>Heh. I didn't do it, mouse!
<P>&gt; Gwendolyn was simply brimming with holiday cheer (and a certain amount of

<P>*much wise nodding* There are groups to help with that, you know. Egg Nog Anonymous comes to mind right off the bat.

<P>no no - i recognize this as resulting from an unfortunate packet drop in transmission - what he meant to report was: :: wolverines gnaw on mouse_ket_ears::
<P>i am certain the wolverines would subject my personal ears to no more than an affectionate nibble (right, otu?)(just remember, guys - _jenn's_ the one who carries steaks in her pockets -- go take a look, she won't mind)
<P>i rather like gwendolyn's hat - altho i hate to think what the tree looks like now.

<P>Well, I assumed it was chicken as well. Definitely a roast fowl. For the record, Mr. Hunt lives in Asia, and I'm not sure if he'd been paying too much attention to when Thanksgiving falls this year.
<P>Oh, and returning momentarily to wolverines, a new addition has joined the horde, Athcu, a wandering stray found by Chris Classic. She's rather less violent and more placid than most wolverines, and has a distinct non-edible fondness for Chris. Here she is, as rendered by the inimitable Napoleon.
<P><img src="http://snaildust.xidus.net/athcu.gif">
<P>Blue certainly suits her, don't you think?

<P>She does have a darling probscis, doesn't she?
<P>Oh, and regarding the earlier wolverine rendering, I checked with Mr. Hunt, who says that he really didn't have any particular fowl in mind when he first rendered Elisabeth, but says it might very well be a turkey, in view of the time of year.
