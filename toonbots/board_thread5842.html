<strong>First Monk, now House</strong>
<P>USA has this thing for shows about non-stupid people; it's kinda neat. I haven't really watched any shows on a regular basis since the mid-90's -- in B-town you can get exactly one, count it one channel on broadcast, and that's PBS. Since offspring #1 was just about PBS age and we didn't want to spend money on cable, that's all we watched. OK, I did watch Bill Moyer regularly. But that's not a show, that was news.
<P>Anyhoo -- House is great. I love the guy. I want to be him when I grow up. Damn, I'll be 40 this year, I guess I'm already as grown up as I'm going to get. Ah well, when the offspring finish college, I'm going to med school. Someplace easy, like Grenada or something. (I like the Caribbean, I'm not going to leave any time soon.)
<P>Speaking of offspring -- offspring #1 is now at sixth-grade level, roughly, and just placed #6 in the regional MathCounts competition, and thus will be competing at the state level in San Juan in March. And that's very cool. And probably due to not getting cable back when she was PBS age, come to think of it, so this whole post is more or less a single coherent topic.
<P>Cool.

<P>There's a ballad in there somewhere. With a Latin beat, of course.
<P>&quot;When my child was young, she did, I confess/
<P>Watch nothing much more than PBS/
<P>But then time went by, and I packed up my tuba/
<P>And moved the whole family to glorious Cuba/
<P>But she continued to thrive, and come the dawn/
<P>She'll be competing in maths in March in San Juan!
<P>March in San Juan! Oh, that march to San Juan. Oh, such glories could come, if the beans aren't overdone.
<P>March to San Juan! Ay, mis hijos I love! She'll be doing equations, with salsa on her glove.

<strong>Re: First Monk, now House</strong>
<P>Yeah, but Puerto Rico doesn't rhyme as well, and then I couldn't fit in the tuba. Puerto Rico makes me think of choreographed gnag warfare.

<P>true...choreography is hard with a tuba.
