<P>Just briefly discovered that myself. Chris Classic is indeed the author fo the aforementioned strip (which would, of course, explain the Toonbots tribute and the presence of wolverines in past strips.)

<P>Hey! Now *that's* the kind of reading we're looking for!
<P>::Godfrey fertively gnaws on the thorax of a lit ant::
<P>&gt; Now, if you'll excuse me, Johnny the Happy Cancer Elf needs my help
<BR>> getting those festively wrapped packages of ants into the sleigh.
<P>Technically, he was a midget, but I suppose it comes to the same thing in the end. (Anyone here ever heard Stan Freberg's &quot;Green Chri$tma$&quot; recording, by the way? I think it was Philip Morris who came out with ads showing cartons of cigarettes decorating the tree, which is what partially inspired the record. An entertaining but also very thought-provoking satire of the commercialization of Christmas. I believe people like Dr. Demento and so forth usually air that record on the radio during December. Worth a listen, imo.)

<strong>Call for Philip Morrr-eeees!</strong>
<P>&gt; http://www.lileks.com/comics/phillipm/phil23.html
<P>&gt; (Check out the rest of that site, too -- the guy's a riot!)
<P>Ah, good old Johnny! I hadn't seen those print ads before, but I know Philip Morris used Johnny in all sorts of media for decades. And this seems like the perfect cue for me to ramble for a few moments about Johnny Roventini.
<P>Johnny Roventini had been a real New York bell-hop, a four-foot midget with a distinctive high-pitched voice, discovered by advertising agency head Milton Biow in 1933, who was suddenly inspired, and had Johnny page Philip Morris on the spot. He was first used in radio spots, sending out his &quot;Call for Philip Morraaaaaiiss,&quot; and supossedly was able to hit a perfect B-flat every time. He was used for years on Philip Morris sponsored radio shows, such as &quot;Crime Doctor,&quot; &quot;It Pays to Be Ignorant&quot; (for a time), &quot;The Milton Berle Show,&quot; and even &quot;The Philip Morris Playhouse&quot; and the variety series whose title he inspired, &quot;Johhny Presents.&quot; It was a successful campaign, but I confess, slightly more so than with many other radio ad campaigns, Johnny does get on my nerves after while (though not as much as the faux Indian chants for Post Toasties, the &quot;Heap Good Cornflakes.&quot;) Still, again, it was used for years, with Johnny serving as a living trademark, making personal appearances, apart from teh radio, print ads, and billboards, &quot;stepping out of storefronts all over America.&quot; (This last slogan was parodied in a &quot;Bullwinkle Show&quot; episode, when moose and squirrel confront a Johnny-like bellhop about this aspect of his work, and &quot;Johnny&quot; replies that he had to stop, because &quot;he kept cutting his fingers on the broken glass.&quot;) Interestingly, Johnny apparently read his &quot;Call for Philip Morris&quot; line from a script, following one occassion when he flubbed the line and the announcer had to take over, in a poor falsetto imitation; the agency refused to take any more chances after that. Though later &quot;Johnny Juniors&quot; were used as understudies and stand-ins (as he could hardly be everywhere at once), Johnny was given a lifetime contract, which continued long after cigarette advertisements were banned from radio and television, and Philip Morris moved on to new advertising angles. Johnny Roventini finally passed away on November 30, 1998, making that &quot;last call for Philip Morraiss,&quot; as one obit put it.

<P>check out the food stuff - his bit on &quot;the decline and fall of western civilization as seen through the medium of jell-o&quot; (http://www.lileks.com/institute/gallery/jello/index.html) had me making unseemly snorting noises all afternoon yesterday.
<P>(also he's got cute pictures of his dog)
<P>i guess there is _some_ progress in the world - at least people no longer hand out cartons of cigarettes wholesale as christmas gifts.

<P>I'm not sure they ever really did, although Phillip Morris sure would have liked it. Talk about crass.
<P>...
<P>Then again, judging from many of my relatives, the 50's and 60's were marked by an incredible degree of crassness. Nothing says &quot;I stopped by the drugstore on the way&quot; like a carton of ciggies or a nice six-pack of beer. Come to think of it, Sam Adams also suggested a six-pack of beer as a suitable Christmas present. So ... maybe there's not been as much progress as we'd all like to think.

<P>Of /course/! Beer! Thanks, Michael! That's what I'll get the little man for Christmas! Heck, maybe I'll even splurge and get him a bag of chips, too. Nothing like gifts that go together. Cause that's just the kind of thoughtful wife I am.
<P>The sad thing is? He'd probably like it. But probably not more than the Palm Pilot tie that he's getting.
<P>I heard that. I know that sound was all of you saying 'Geek!' even though you tried to hide it as a sneeze.

<P>Uhhh, was NOT! Is it a Palm Pilot built INTO a tie? Or just a tie that you carry your Palm Pilot in? Does it come with a stylus? Is it the color tie or just the greyscale one? *cough* Not that I want one. I also want to point out how funny the phrase &quot;palm pilot&quot; is, and how much all my geek friends tittered at it until they bought their own.

<P>Oh. That would be really cool.
<P>&gt; Or just a tie that you
<BR>> carry your Palm Pilot in?
<P>That would be cool, too. But alas, I'm not /that/ cool a wife. It's a tie with pictures of pilots on it. Besides, he already has a /holster/ to hold his (I guess it's a Visor, not a Palm). That's right. One of those under the arm jobbies like they hold guns in. Only special made to hold a pilot. Visor. Whatever. See, I called the Pilot a 'Palm' for the first eternity that he had it and was constantly being told not to call it a Palm. So now that I have a 50 percent hit rate on calling it a Pilot, he goes and changes to Visor and it starts all over. I have found that referring to it as 'The Other Woman.' works like a charm, though.
<P>&gt; Is it the color tie
<BR>> or just the greyscale one?
<P>Greyscale. Looks like the older versions, too. It's a retro tie. Retro's in, right?
<P>&gt; *cough* Not that I want one.
<P>Too late. Your kids have already been notified. The warehouse has been contacted and you're getting a Pilot tie for Christmas, birthday and Father's Day for the next 15 years. Enjoy.

<P>My boss was calling hers a &quot;goddamlittletoy&quot; for a while, since HER boss said that all his managers had to have them and USE them and beam things to him from them and so forth. Not that she's not tech-savvy for a boss, but apparently the PDA's have a wonderful gift of eliminating the part of your brain that used to do whatever it is the PDA now does, meaning that they've become impossible to live without.

<P>see, this is what i mean - the big boss has one, so everyone has to have them, so he has people to play with. and now they have to actually spend time coming up with things to beam to him. the root question is, of course - how tech-savvy is he?

<P>I don't wear ties much. I have a &quot;funeral tie&quot; and a &quot;wedding tie&quot;, both of which happen to refer to the same tie. I also have an &quot;emergency tie&quot; at work, so if there's a big meeting, I've got one to throw on. Now, since the shirts I wear don't really lend themselves to ties (having either no collar or no top buttons), it's always fun to wear the emergency tie. I also own a red tie with giant roosters on it that my grandfather gave me, and which manages to clash with every known color in the visible range of light. I think that's why he bought it. I love that one.

<P>I have quite a few ties, but seldom have an opportunity to wear them. However, at an academic honors whatsit, I was finally able to wear my Pink Panther tie (a pattern of a cartoon Inspector Clouseau following the colorful cat, against a dark blue background), even though I did need to buy new pants to go with it. Other cartoon themed ties include several featuring Rocky and Bullwinkle (purchased when I was in 7th grade for some function or other), and a very nice one depicting the Grinch's floating green eyes (which I really should wear some time soon.)

<P>Mmmm. I gotta say...if I got one it would just be for the games. I really like that Drug Lord game. I can't remember what it's called, but you jet around NYC selling and buying drugs and try to make a profit. It's /hard/ being a drug lord!
<P>Anyway, my point for this post was to say that the pilot has Changed Husband's Life. He is no longer late for every appointment he makes. Yes, yes, yes. You could do that with a date book. /If/ you used a date book. For some strange reason, because it's Technology, he'll use it. Pen and paper? No.
<P>But see, that's not normal in any sense of the word. The only thing I will say about the pilot is that you can cram a heck of a lot of information in a small space. My date/address book, a petite little thing, is almost twice the size.
