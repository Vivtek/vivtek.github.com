<strong>Re: Titles</strong>
<P>&gt; Sooo... Ya like my character bounding boxes? Aren't they cool?
<P>Yes indeed! Very pleased to be able to read a new Toonbots so soon. Oddly enough, those blank rectangles are, in my opinion, better representations of the candidates than those used by print cartoonists. While they are content with wildly varying depictions of the pairs' physical features, you have captured the very blankness of their personalities and especially their platforms. There was a certain wistfulness in the position of &quot;Dubya&quot; in the final panel, which nicely complemented the caption.
<P>The introduction of characters is a resounding success, in my opinion, and still manages to retain that unique Toonbots charm.

As for you, nd, do you think you can simply use us to further you egotistical needs of a foolishly long title? The PAFTWJ is not the Universal Life Church; we do not simply hand out titles upon a whim so you can circumvent the law. Our titles are only given to those who truly know the spirit of Toonbots in their hearts. nd must pay for his insolence! Jihad! To arms!

<P>Dunno if you thought of this, but a whois on boxjamsdoodle.com gives and address in what appears to be a residential area of Glenview, IL (which is about 20 miles or so north of Chicago). I've been thinking about making a pilgrimage to there wearing a blue muumuu, but I've been having trouble finding the time (a pilgrimage to BoxJam's sounds neat and all, but not quite up to the excuse for a 600 mile road trip level.)

<strong>Re: Chris' Title</strong>
<P>&gt; You should feel blessed, Pooga. You have been given an auxilary title from
<BR>> the Meta-Cartoonist Himself. Your name will be sung by the bards for
<BR>> generations to come.
<P>I realize this, and am honored beyond measure. Of course, I'm not sure of the scale to be used when measuring honor, but I'm sure whatever it is, I've been honored beyond the level which could be determined on the standard measuring devices, whatever they may be.
<P>I have this song going through my head ever since I discovered my auxilary title. It's &quot;I'm in Love With a Girl Named Fred&quot; from &quot;Once Upon a Matress&quot;. If you've heard the song you probably know why.

<P>No one said that &quot;Pooga&quot; needs to be rhymed, though. You could always do something like this:
<P>Pooga is great Pooga is good We should all do What Pooga would.
<P>...except hopefully slightly more creative than that. Or, the bards could occaisonally use the full name, Pooga Poogissima, which should be much easier to rhyme.
