<strong>PAFTWJ Anthem #2: An Ode to Michael</strong>
<P>Presenting another attempt at a Jihad anthem, once again inspired by a song from the musical version of Les Miserables (&quot;Master of the House,&quot; and a midi file for the tune can be found here: http://home.netvigator.com/~misaki/master.mid). This time, an ode to Michael himself! (I hope this formats correctly the first time, for once.)
<P>Master of the Dot,
<br>Keeper of the Perl,
<br>Steps aside when Nappy wants to window hurl,</p>

<P>Kind father and spouse,
<br>Meta-cartoonist,
<br>Able to mine humor from dead Communists,</p>

<P>Updates whene'er he pleases,
<br>Writing code behind the scenes,
<br>Continually teases with loud cries of &quot;NEXT: WOLVERINES!&quot;</p>

<P>Master of the Dot,
<br>Pokey devotee,
<br>Revels in his meta-fictionality.</p>

<P>Works in his basement,
<br>There for all to see,
<br>Busier than all the apes of Hungary!</p>

<P>Yes, the Jihad all love Michael,
<br>Though we are a surly lot.
<br>Everybody give a hand,
<br>From across this meta-land,
<br>Everybody give a hand to the master of the dot!</p>

<P>Sigh. This forum simply does not like to format verse properly. It has no poetry in it's soul.

<P>Gasp! Emsworth! You committed...a SPELLING ERROR!
<P>How COULD you!
<P>Peace, Tim Bram.

<P>&gt; Gasp! Emsworth! You committed...a SPELLING ERROR!
<P>&gt; How COULD you!
<P>After 10 PM MST, fairly easily, unfortunately. &quot;Its&quot; not &quot;it's,&quot; I know. Unfortunately, while I try to be careful, spelling errors do occur (unlike other forums, this one lacks the &quot;edit&quot; function, which is all the more reason to be more careful, I know.)
<P>Plus, Usu had been teething on the keyboard again.

<strong>By the way.....</strong>
<P>Michael, I'd appreciate it if you could try to correct the horrid formatting for that ode to yourself, when you have the time, and assuming you're not too much of a surly jerk. Much obliged. The rows of hyphens were used in the hoped of encouraging WebBBS to leave appropriate space between stanzas while possibly leaving single spaces between verses, and it didn't. Sigh.

<BR>> formatting for that ode to yourself, when you have the time, and assuming

<P>OR MAYBE I'LL JUST BE A SURLY JERK!
<P>...
<P>Not today. I'll see if I have the energy tomorrow (although my dad is visiting, so that will shoot the afternoon and probably evening) or maybe the weekend. I'm so completely behind with all my actual work that I'm not actually promising anything.
<P>And what do I do in my free time? I write proposals for more work. I've been told this is how real business owners do things. I find that it turns out to be true. And actually, after five years independent consulting, I guess I have to begin to admit that I *am* a real business owner, and not just some guy sitting in his basement playing with computers.
<P>I'm sure that you all will be greatly happy to hear that I seem to have begun the process of designing a new forum software platform. This will make it much easier to format things -- in fact, it will give you a great deal of power in formatting but won't force you to use it. The system will be vaguely Wiki-based, meaning that you can start your own little corners of the forum, upload graphics and stuff, and things like that. It will also be possible to lock some pages, and full version control will be built in, so that just in case we get a vandal, all is not lost.
<P>This won't be happening soon. But it's on its way. Slowly. I'm in the process of writing a proposal for some nice people in Berlin which will fund the development of some of the key pieces of the system. Thus begins my plot to build solid open-source enterprise software and undermine the entire system of fat-cat consultants which suckle at the Fortune 500 teat. BWAHAHAHAHA! The world shall be mine! AH-HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! *coff* I hate it when I do that.

<P>Or maybe not. Thanks for the ode, Emsworth. Nobody's ever composed an ode to me before.

<P>Honorable meta-cartoonist welcome for thanks, will return same regarding formatting, and glad to know that humble self's efforts were appreciated.

<strong>Re: Oh, well, what the heck</strong>
<P>Just chiming in to say that it was a good little song, followed the meter and everything! I know cause I sang it aloud at work. And it's occured to me that most of the odd behavior that I do at work stems from either this strip or the forum.
<P>Is that just me or does that happen to everyone? It's helpful when I'm trying to explain to my husband Why I'm Not Insane if I can say 'the Jihad does it too'. He hasn't worked out yet that that's not actually a good reason for Why I'm Not Insane.

<P>Okay. That's a valid reason.
<P>&gt; Plus, Usu had been teething on the keyboard again.
<P>I suppose that's an even more valid reason....
