<P>Oh my frickin sweet Mary mother of Jehosophat, that is the funniest thing I've seen ... maybe ever. Tirdun, you simply reek of talent.
<P>&gt; Uh, the XML thing on this one is tricky ;)
<P>Yeah, I'm working on props. And spacing. And stuff. But it's absolutely wonderful, man. I'm touched. I never thought I'd get fan art for my wife's presentation.

<P>He's disgusting, is what he is? Have you seen his later BoxJam spinoffs? They're so brilliant we just decided to stop before BoxJam even had a chance to make a page for them.

<P>Bah, fat chance of that. Speaking of which, I note the Jihad page features neither my other fanarts nor Emsworth's recent excellent submission.
<P>NOT SO SUBTLE HINT.
<P>And where's our web-interface, well documented, instant-result Toonbots build page? Huh? HUH?!? Feh. ;)

<P>I figured since it's all linked off the forum archive anyway, there's not so much .... oh, OK.
<P>&gt; And where's our web-interface, well documented, instant-result Toonbots
<BR>> build page? Huh? HUH?!? Feh. ;)
<P>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That's a good one.
<P>Let's see. Today I have to finish an article for IBM developerWorks that I promised for last week. Then I have to start researching the next, which I technically promised for the end of this week. Then I have to work on site searching for AMTDA, and I have to continue to get the nsfreetds driver working for Techspex so I can switch their database from Illustra (which sucks) to SQL Server (which at least sucks quickly). I have to get invoices out for two customers. I need to get documentation done for the last round of wftk development. I have to get started on the Nordrhein-Westfalen contract so I can get it finished by their target date, which is uncomfortably close. I've got requests for three database bindings for wftk (Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL).
<P>I've also got a lot of work on Despammed.com that's been piling up, I've got my regular sysadmin duties at Techspex which have been lagging, the Tea House (one of my customers) hasn't heard from me in about three months, my Verisign SSL certificate stopped working for reasons unknown, I've got two different partnerships starting up for workflow, and I'm heavily involved in an extremely interesting local startup having to do with database-backed websites in the realty industry (and there's a workflow component of that, too).
<P>I've got to write a whitepaper as to &quot;why workflow?&quot;. I have a storyline to continue (new for me). I have two kids and a wife. I have graduate work. My wife has a paper she's working on. The tiles in the bathroom need replacement around the toilet -- they've only been missing for a year and a half now -- the gutters need cleaing or my office will be inundated again.
<P>So I guess what I'm saying for all you pathetic schmucks that only have one job is -- &quot;Take a number, bub.&quot; (Of *course* I know it was good-natured ribbing. But sometimes it feels good to get onto a really good rant. At least I don't make it a regular site feature, like *some* people.)

<P>Yeah, people suck. So what... next week sometime? Mid June? Mid-June 2003?

<strong>Re: Kaon Fanart</strong>

<P>Well, next week isn't looking good, is it? Maybe by July. I don't have a really good excuse at this point, because it's now all pretty standard software. Nothing funky. But to be perfectly honest, if I'm going to do this, I want to think it through and do it right, because it'll be a cool enough toy that it will almost certainly be slashdotted. And that's why I need some control over it.
<P>Besides, this could be my one real chance at slashdotting and I want it to count.

<P>You know, most sites would weep like women and run screaming to erect firewalls at the thought of being slashdotted. Or just run screaming and erect. I forget....

<P>It'll pass. Slashdotters aren't what you'd call consistent. They get distracted really easily.
