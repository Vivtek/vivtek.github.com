<P>usually i do (it's probably some sort of compulsive disorder). today, being a bit short of time, i came here first - and, as ever when i do that, then realized that there was a new toon. hey - maybe _i'm_ the one with the power to cause toons to appear!

<strong>YAY! New Toon!</strong>
<P>I always go to the toon page first, cause I can't figure out how to change the bookmark on our thingie. And because it's good exercise, clicking that 'forum here' button.
<P>Whew! I'd better go have a cold beer, I clicked!
<P>Anyway, we should have a party in honor of the new toon! I'll bring the cheese dip!

<strong>Re: By the way....</strong>

<P>Was that a whine or a statement of fact? (Unless you're trying to make us hate you, I'll assume the latter.) Your logs will reveal I have checked periodically, and since I'm still allegedly on your update mailing list anyway, and you hadn't updated in months, and hadn't since I last checked a couple of days ago, and since I'm trying to prepare for the Con and fit into clothing despite leg swelling, no, no I hadn't.
<P>I enjoyed it, though. Simple, and despite an extremely self-indulgent blurb, very effective. Liked the &quot;spot&quot; gag especially.
<P>

<strong>Re: By the way....</strong>

<P>Well, um...you see, about those logs... Yeah. *cough* I just hope I've moved back to the dorms before Michael comes back to actually check any log claims. There's a couple of unused IPs on this subnet, so maybe I can just tell the person replacing me to leave that one alone for deniability.

<strong>clarification</strong>
<P>Good Brother Emsworth (as opposed to his evil twin) has just informed me that my last entry was bit confusing to some, and possibly a bit overdone with the faux paranoia and all. So, for the record, I am not nor have I ever lived in Michael's house. I'm just filling up his filesystem with meaningless log entries. It's kind of like NIMDA all over again, but in Jihad form.

<P>Because...living in Michael's house and eating his pickles and rearranging his collection of Strawberry Shortcake figurines...that would be a /bad/ thing, right?
<P>The rest of that gibberish, I didn't understand at all. But then, I don't read the code on the comics (don't all gasp at once).
<P>Reiterating. Bad thing, living in Michael's house. Good thing, living in dorms and speaking in acronyms. :)

<strong>Re: clarification</strong>
<P>foo - there goes another perfectly good conspiracy theory. and i practically had floor plans for the hideout you would have constructed in the basement (behind the towers, for easy yet covert access to the logs). honestly, you people are just no fun at all.
<P>and yet....tell me more of this 'evil twin'....

<P>If the Good Brother Emsworth is to exist, which I presume that he does, then his opposite, the Evil Brother Emsworth, must exist, else there is no comparison and no basis to define the original. So Emsworth obviously has an evil twin lurking out there somewhere. I've never met himself, so I can't say much on what he's like. Maybe the Good Emsworth can tell you more.

<strong>Re: Emsworth The Oh So Goodly Evil</strong>
<P>Madame, I resent those remarks, and consider them to be inimical to good fellowship.
<P>And yes, I'm back. No Gooey-gar or even mouse autographs, Michael, too busy and tired. Maybe you can take time off from Hungary next year and try it yourself. And the box of Hitler-O's I saw in one booth would have been perfect for a Toonbots.

<P>Merely an assumption given my lack of updatedness. I haven't looked at my logs for a very long time now. And I didn't send a notification because I forgot it existed, to be perfectly honest. It was never automatic, just a quick little outgoing-only majordomo list.
