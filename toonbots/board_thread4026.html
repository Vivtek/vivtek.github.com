<P>Huzzah! My hiatus submission has at last seen the light of day! Frabjous day, callooh callay and words to that effect! Glad Michael was amused by my blurb.
<P>::wolverines applaud and growl in a cheering manner::
<P>Ahem. Not much more to say about it at the moment, though I'm very elated by this. Will have more to say tomorrow (which is a significant day.)

<P>&gt; Huzzah! My hiatus submission has at last seen the light of day! Frabjous
<BR>> day, callooh callay and words to that effect! Glad Michael was amused by
<BR>> my blurb.
<P>Definitely worthy of display. It almost makes as little sense as Michael's usual episodes.
<P>&gt; Ahem. Not much more to say about it at the moment, though I'm very elated
<BR>> by this. Will have more to say tomorrow (which is a significant day.)
<P>So it is. I would have missed it without your reminder. However, I have now entered it into my PDA, so I should be able to join celebrations on time without being surprised.
<P>Peace, Tim Bram.

<P>I've submitted it to the corporate calendar, so there's always that chance that everyone in my company will be celebrating with a collective &quot;HUH!??!&quot;
<P>I think it's fitting. Unlikely, but fitting. I'm sure InfoSys won't add it to the official list. They love me.

<P>Well, Michael chose to use an earlier date to label the latest date, for reasons of his own, and I merely followed suit when starting this thread. The significant day I referred to, as you no doubt know by now, is the 384th anniversary of the Defenestration of Prague, which is the most significant of Jihad holy days.

<P>Actually I was shooting for a wftk v1.0 release today. I very much doubt that anyone in the open-source movement would realize the importance of the date, but hey. I cultivate an image of being offbeat even among the offbeat.

<strong>May 22, anyway</strong>
<P>Sigh. This is your metacartoonist on drugs. I originally published this episode as 20020222, even thinking, wow, lots of 2's. Not realizing, of course, that May is typically not considered the second month.

<P>ah! but mayvember would be (11+5)/2 = ...8....which isn't much help...unless! you change the date to 020222, then 0+2+0+2+2+2 = 8!
<P>i love math games.
