<strong>apologies for janune 23</strong>
<P>it really is too verbose, not that that's bad in itself, but it does get confusing with the panel layout. i guess i hadn't noticed that while smaller panels were possible, larger ones seem not to be (what can i say, it was funny in my head - maybe it needed the announcer's voice....)
<P>hey michael! that's it - you could include an audio bit to play an announcer's voice (although computer-generated voices don't have that lovely smoothness of the professional announcer, although with advances in ai, maybe they could learn smoothness (you could work on that).....but then maybe the mechanical voice is funnier, i don't know... and you could just sorta _scroll_ the text under the voice, just as something to look at, and then you wouldn't have to go to all the trouble of figuring out larger panel sizes and balloons.
<P>(what _would_ you do without me to suggest all these simplifications?)

<P>-I- laughed at it. It was confusing in a Toonbotty way, giving me the impression that the reason I didn't understand some of it was because I wasn't MEANT to understand. Either way, it was a good thing.
<P>And Al playing the dog still makes me laugh.

<P>It's a good sign that I'm even *this* active.

<P>Thank *you* for three excellent episodes! You realize you're the first person to have written actual episodes on the main track, right? Damonk scripted a few for the crossover, but I had to *script* them, and you *know* what I mean. Emsworth was the first person to submit any XML, though. Way, way back. Also the first fan art. He's so cool. And peanutty!

<P>you are welcome - rather fun to play with this stuff.
<P>&gt; You realize you're the first
<BR>> person to have written actual episodes on the main track, right?
<P>'on the main track'....is there one? is it good i'm on it? (is that a train whistle i hear?)
<P>&gt; Emsworth was the first person to submit any XML,
<BR>> though. Way, way back. Also the first fan art. He's so cool. And peanutty!
<P>yes - and when _are_ you going to find _his_ episode? even tho from way back - it would be kind of a neat flashback sorta thing.
