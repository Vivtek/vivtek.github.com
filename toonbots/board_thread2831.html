<strong>Niagara Falls</strong>
<P>Hello everyone! It's advice time!
<P>Heow and I are going to Niagara Falls over the Thanksgiving weekend. I was wondering if anyone had been and had any advice for us? I've already heard 'steer clear of the American side' and 'what are you going in winter for anyways?'.
<P>My parents went around this time a couple of years ago and they really liked it. In spite of most tourist trap areas being closed for the season. It's not like they can shut off the falls.
<P>Anybody been and really enjoyed something about it? How about this Daredevil Museum I keep seeing on websites? Hokey fun for the whole family or horrible waste of time?

<strong>Re: Niagara Falls</strong>
<P>well, i don't actually know anything about it, but i'm always happy to give advice. i figure any time you can avoid crowds and tourist traps, you start out on the plus side. and if the leaf colors are still good -- well, what else could you want?
<P>oh yea, advice - don't wear the brand new shoes you just bought and never wore before.

<P>&gt; oh yea, advice - don't wear the brand new shoes you just bought and never
<BR>> wore before.
<P>Awww! I suppose you're going to advise against the 6 inch heels for tromping around the National Park, too, huh? Kill joy.
<P>And as to tourist traps...that's a hard call. There are times when looking at kitzch is a heck of a lot of fun, especially when said kitzch is thinly disguised as a 'museum'. Heow and I have high hopes of finding perhaps a glow in the dark Jesus in a barrel going over the falls snowglobe for our 'Tacky Jesus' collection. Though we couldn't find a single Jesus the whole time we were in Vegas and I really thought that if I was going to get a black velvet Jesus in Elvis costume, Vegas would be the place to get it. *sigh*

<strong>Elvis and Cheating</strong>
<P>a) Elvis as Jesus would have been fine but the closest we could come to religious symbolism at all was St. Something, the Saint of Television. And we even went to those really large souvenier shops at the north end of the strip. *sigh* No Jesus from Vegas. Maybe Niagara will treat us better.

<P>This is a very crowded mental image I've got going on. Mouse and sharks and me frantic to get back into/onto... whatever floating vessel I was in/on.
<P>I wonder when/if Michael will notice that you've split reality in twain somewhere back there :)
<P>&gt; i always wanted to be part of a plot.
<P>Everybody wants to be part of a good plot. Conspiracies are nice, but sometimes they get that oogie /dirty/ feel about them. Schemes are also fun, if you don't get bogged down in the details. Plots, however, are always very straightforward and you never have to worry too much.

<P>I noticed it when it first split, of course, but you all seemed so happy I didn't want to say anything -- particularly the fact that the duplication is just a duplicated reference to Jenn's first duplicated message and that the standings don't use the references but rather tally up the files themselves (each post being a single file in the directory.)

<P>Yes, fear the black forest of Pun, lest you get lost and become like Piers Anthony, mocked by millions. The pun, well timed and used sparingly (like curry) can be amusing and witty. Used poorly, it will overpower and destroy the flavor. Once down the path of the pun you have walked, forever will it haunt you.
<P>Movie quoting, on the other hand, can never be overused. Like sugar.

<P>Ohhhh....that was /brilliant/, Tirdun...the subtle nuances with the mice with the little sunglasses and mouse and the whole thing. I shiver in delight.
<P>And HEY! I'm not evil! I'm deeply misunderstood, at most.
<P>&gt; I'm very tired. I'm just skirted past the reefs of midterms and am
<BR>> crossing the vast gulf of research papers. Just off in the distance are
<BR>> the rocks of presentations and then it's smooth sailing until the stormy
<BR>> seas of finals. Plus work wants me to do.... work. How are you?
<P>I am a shark of distraction, slipping deadly through the Strait of Tirdun, waiting for an unawares bather to pop in for a quick dip.

<P>This is a very crowded mental image I've got going on. Mouse and sharks and me frantic to get back into/onto... whatever floating vessel I was in/on.
<P>I wonder when/if Michael will notice that you've split reality in twain somewhere back there :)
<P>&gt; i always wanted to be part of a plot.
<P>Everybody wants to be part of a good plot. Conspiracies are nice, but sometimes they get that oogie /dirty/ feel about them. Schemes are also fun, if you don't get bogged down in the details. Plots, however, are always very straightforward and you never have to worry too much.

<P>I noticed it when it first split, of course, but you all seemed so happy I didn't want to say anything -- particularly the fact that the duplication is just a duplicated reference to Jenn's first duplicated message and that the standings don't use the references but rather tally up the files themselves (each post being a single file in the directory.)
<P>That could, I suppose, be called an &quot;anvilette&quot;.

<P>Yes, fear the black forest of Pun, lest you get lost and become like Piers Anthony, mocked by millions. The pun, well timed and used sparingly (like curry) can be amusing and witty. Used poorly, it will overpower and destroy the flavor. Once down the path of the pun you have walked, forever will it haunt you.
<P>Movie quoting, on the other hand, can never be overused. Like sugar.

<P>Well, I think I've just decided I need another title. Insanely Wicked Naughty Evil is way too good to pass up. Especially when I'm so good and pure and innocent and sweet. It will be like that reverse sarcasm thing. What's the word I'm looking for? (hey, it's early and I'm still chugging endorphins from walking to work this morning. Lemme alone.)
<P>&gt; Hey, I have a strait named after me! Does it have a sign? It has to. I'll

<P>And I'd like to point out that it's /awfully/ hard being good, pure, innocent and sweet when people are always dangling bait like that in front of my nose. Excuse me. I think I just got an invitation to a feeding frenzy. A good, pure, innocent and sweet one. I'll be right back.

<strong>Re: Niagara Falls</strong>
<P>&gt; Heow and I are going to Niagara Falls over the Thanksgiving weekend. I was
<BR>> wondering if anyone had been and had any advice for us? I've already heard
<BR>> 'steer clear of the American side' and 'what are you going in winter for
<BR>> anyways?'.
<P>I've been to both sides, and my advice is, if you don't have much time, see the Canadian side, but if you do have a little time, see both. Definitely go on the boat trip. Go into the tunnels under the Canadian side and meditate on the fact that the tunnels you see which are closed because they're being eroded away are the ones I visited as a child.... The Falls are moving upstream at something like a foot a year. Amazing. Geologically speaking, they're very, very evanescent and we're lucky to get to see them.
<P>For just plain meditation, I liked walking on the Canadian side and just sitting where you can see through the lip of the falls; the water is several feet deep, and right at the edge you can look through it.
<P>The American side has lots of little paths and bridges and stuff. Very pretty, and nice views of the Canadian side. I think it's worthwhile visiting.
<P>As for time of year -- who cares? It's water. It falls. I'd like to see it in the winter sometime. Dress warmly.
<P>&gt; My parents went around this time a couple of years ago and they really
<BR>> liked it. In spite of most tourist trap areas being closed for the season.
<P>I rather think I'd like it *because* the tourist crap, I mean TRAP, areas are closed. Along with the mindless hordes not being there.
<P>&gt; It's not like they can shut off the falls.
<P>Exactly.
<P>&gt; Anybody been and really enjoyed something about it? How about this
<BR>> Daredevil Museum I keep seeing on websites? Hokey fun for the whole family
<BR>> or horrible waste of time?
<P>Never been. We don't care for most of that garbage. Go see the falls. Have fun seeing something that's not human.
