<strong>On this day...</strong>
<P>-=The Defenestration of Prague=-
<P>The sparking event of the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). The Bohemian nobility was in more or less open revolt against the Emperor and at a meeting of the Bohemian Estates at the Hrdcany Castle in Prague on 23 May 1618, the assembled Bohemian nobles took the two Imperial governors:
<P>Wilhelm Graf Slavata Jaroslav Borzita Graf von Martinicz
<P>and threw them out of a window of the castle and into a ditch. Neither man was seriously injured as a result of being defenestrated.
<P>Future defenestrations were used as a means of suicide by deposed heads of state or as a tool in internet forums for quieting dissenters, trolls, flamers or those who have broached (often unspoken and vague) local netiquitte.

<P>To land in or to eat?
<P>Landing in Jell-O goes outside the front window...yes the one that's already broken. Has been for years.
<P>Eating Jell-O goes in the fridge for dessert. Unless it's a Jell-O salad in which case I'll put it to the vote as to whether it should be donated to the starving instead.

<P>&gt; To land in or to eat?
<P>this is the wonder of jello - good for all purposes. it depends on whether the jello contains nuts or similiar lumpy objects. such jello is intended only for eating (or possible food fights); one wants the softer (unlumpified) type to land on.
<P>or we could make the jello wobblers, or whatever they are called (the ones with 2X the jello for the liquid), and use it for trampolines!

<P>I always assumed &quot;wobble&quot; meant a slower and more ... determined sort of side to side movement while &quot;jiggle&quot; meant a faster and unpredictable gyration. So if we are to make wobblers sans jigglers, how do you get out the jigg and put in the wobb as it were?
<P>::Sudden mental image of Mr Burns (in the exercise episode): &quot;Bring in the Wobb, push out the jigg... Excellent&quot;.
<P>Wow... where did THAT come from?
<P>I'm organizing a defenestration side sport wherein you attempt to pelt the defenestratee in mid-defenestration with jello. Points are awarded by artistic style rather than accuracy.

<P>Probably by the simple inclusion of substantial quantities of Philadelphia cream cheese. Helps to stiffen the substance, and also provides a certain sharpness to counter the sugary sweetness. Top with pimentos, serves 8.

<P>ummm, cream cheese....of course you have to beat it well before you blend it in (once suffered through the efforts of a cook who added cream cheese to jello in blobs - after the stuff had been sitting awhile, it underwent a rather strange transformation into distinctly hard objects, which caused those foolish enough to eat the stuff to wobble more than a little)

<P>::smacks forehead with hand, recovers consciousness, realises that hand should be empty when trying that:: I forgot to specify that food-fight Jell-O stays outside to be used to pelt the imperial governors.
<P>&gt; or we could make the jello wobblers, or whatever they are called (the ones
<BR>> with 2X the jello for the liquid), and use it for trampolines!
<P>That would require that someone thought of it in advance. In case someone did, all trampolines should also go outside, but on the other side of the house from the defenestration zone. No point in the casual party-goer enjoying the trampoline being hit by flying imperial governors or splashing Jell-O.
<P>&gt; glad you're back, tim!
<P>Why, thank you. I didn't realise I would be missed. ::sniffs happily::
<P>I hope to be a little more active than I have been. My cancer and the treatment thereof got me a little slow and weak for a while.
<P>(Hrm. I'm assuming everyone knows that I have untreatable Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a caner of the immune system? Basically, they've tried everything in the arsenal that could cure me, so my oncologist is trying to keep me alive and semi-well. Hence the references to my meds (medications) and my incoherence at times.)
<P>And of course, having mentioned hence, we almost mustn't forget the eggs for throwing at the defenstratees. (&quot;What do you mean they should be raw? Hard boiled hit much harder.&quot;)
<P>Okay, now I'm just being silly.

<P>Never thought of that. I do have a slightly rusted trampoline, but should anyone insist on using comestibles, may I suggest over-sized lemon meringue pies over Jell-O. The crust provides a surer foundation.

<P>How about this. We'll use the sugar free Jell-O for landing purposes, and serve the regular orange Jell-O with whipped cream. I've made up a btahc of strawberry jigglers as well.
<P>There's also popcorn, parmesan flavored goldfish crackers, chopped ham, swiss, large stuffed olives, and cucumber salad. We *had* cream cheese on bagels and danishes (and also a new table cloth and silver serving spoon), but the wolverines got peckish. Only have kiwi strawberry soda and lemonade myself.

<P>my word, but you set a lovely table. i agree, the sugar free jell-o has no use as an edible, and is best suited for landing purposes. the rest of the menu sounds quite filling, even without the bagels and danish (hope whoever ate the spoon is not having any difficulties - a few raw eggs can help to lubricate the system - or some butter - plus it makes for a lovely shiny coat). i think i have some ginger ale around - happy to bring it along.

<P>Wilhelm Graf Slavata

<P>I suppose that's good, but what then was the point? And if they weren't hurt, were they defenestrated from the ground floor?

<P>These are, of course, the only true uses of the Art.
