<strong>Off to San Diego</strong>
<P>Apologies for not having anything intelligent or mildly amusing or even random babbling to post during the past few days. However, I'll be leaving in the morning, off to San Diego for the Comic-Con. Napoleon plans to join me for cartoony fun on Sunday. I should be back early next week, though.
<P>Oh, and I noticed an interesting recent post to &quot;The Class Menagerie&quot; forum by &quot;Uniqueusername&quot; in the following thread (the first post):http://www.keenspot.com/KeenBoard/Forum40/HTML/000899.html
<P>You know, Michael, Joe Stalin's one of the few noted Commies who hasn't been used yet. Joe Stalin and waffles... doesn't that sound like perfect Toonbots material?
<P>Well, farewell to all for now! We'll be meta-fictionally taking the wolverines, btw.
<P>::wolverines are now hungry for Jimmy Olsen comics::

<P>Franco hasn't been used, either. He held power for longer than any commie except Castro, I think... Darn world history.

<P>Um, Brian? Franco wasn't a communist. He was a fascist. There is a difference, particularly to communists and fascists.

<P>Mmm, darn fanataical US conditioning. They were all &quot;those dirty reds&quot; to me growing up. I stand corrected.

<P>Well, he's dead at least. Castro's not dead, so technically he shouldn't be a Toonbots character. The question is whether a live communist is or isn't further from the central core concept than a dead fascist, I guess...

<P>If you wait long enough the live communist part shouldn't be a problem. You can just pretend that the toons with Castro were written in the future. Probably a result of that time travel feature that you'll write for the toon-o-matic.

<P>&gt; gopher who?
<P>Yeah, I'm still alive. Going home didn't really go well for me. I'll be sure to put a bit more effort into avoiding it in the future. The high priest would never abandon the jihad! Or somthing like that.

<P>Probably more like the jihad would hunt him down and gently remind him of his duties... ;)
