<strong>Con Pics 2003</strong>
<P>Belatedly developed, and expensive new scanner isn't as good as it should be, but still (almost all pics taken by the pater or someone else, due to my disability)....
<P>http://members.aol.com/hungrywolverines/JihadCon.jpg
<P>From the day I gave my presentation. From left to right, honorable mouse, Chris Garver, and self. Not the best scan, but my appearance is even worse. Hunched shoulders, glasses, disheveled hair, askew tie, odd grimace, and cane, I look as if I'm about to raise the latter and holler &quot;Mad, they called me? MAD?? Come to me, my pretties! Devour Stan Lee!&quot;
<P>http://members.aol.com/hungrywolverines/Gooeygar.jpg
<P>Self and Brad Guigar. He looks less dapper than he did on the day of the panel (his and mine), but we had a nice but brief visit. Second Con day, I think.
<P>http://members.aol.com/hungrywolverines/M00se.jpg
<P>Interior of the Dudley Do-Right Emporium on Sunset Blvd. Note the sign.
<P>http://members.aol.com/hungrywolverines/APA.jpg
<P>APAToons members breakfast. From lower left, self, Milt Gray (co-editor of Funnyworld, animator for Bakshi, director on Simpsons, asst. animator on Jungle Book), Jerry Beck (author of numerous reference books), Dave Gerstein (from Denmark, writes Disney comics in Europe), Joshua Smith (fellow amateur fan), Harry McCracken (HarryMccracken.com), and Bob Miller, storyboard artist for numerous WB series, and also Courage the Cowardly Dog.

<P>well, i don't remember you mentioning stan lee, precisely, but...
<P>and you should mention this was taken _after_ your talk - you looked fine for that.
<P>_i_, on the other hand, look like i am coming down with leprosy, or something - i mean, i know i stood in line for quite a while, but i didn't realize i had turned _that_ red! so if any of the rest of you run into me sometime: 1) i am not usually contagious and b) i have never to my knowlege ever actually glowed in the dark from sunburn.
<P>the rest of the pictures are pretty good, though - i love the sign in the dudley do-right emporium (although one is tempted to try a little something, just to see what would happen....)

<P>One fears you were doing so right then, in the not-so-deep infrared. Beware! Beware! thrice round her weave a ring of late octember clemency, lest she ignite the unwary and herself!

<P>something miniony and painful, i fancy. one wonders however whether said hit squad hath met ... the Wolverines!

<P>Now now. Napoleon and I have raised our horde properly. They're aware of the moral and legal implications, so they would never shoplift. Destruction of property and amiably fuzzy bodily assault are another matter altogether, of course.

<P>ah, perhaps we have been misunderstood. we are well aware, myself included, that our wolverines' kind, gentle, and moral natures would never countenance, would find abhorent and would indeed anathematize, such larceny against a duly established place of Moose and Squirrel. it is indeed the risk of damage both personal and proper to the minions of Fearless Leader in the course of the pursuit of our wolverines' happiness (most delectably pursued, indeed, in assorted benevolent mayhem and battery upon the persons and property of such truly worthies as these) to which i referred.
<P>and now, lest our dear, kind wolverines find it in their joyful hearts to join in our general violent agreement to the detriment of our general health, may we thoughtfully direct their attention in a more favourable direction, viz., towards those that follow where Fearless Leads?

<P>i think you'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs* - otherwise they're likely to get lost in that sentence.
<P>*or possibly spleens. whatever is easiest.

<P>Oddly enough, today's Jumble included the words &quot;Oaken,&quot; &quot;Adult,&quot; &quot;Waiter,&quot; and &quot;Spleen.&quot; As in &quot;An adult wolverine can gnaw through an oaken table to dine on the waiter's spleen.&quot;
