<strong>Another Wodehouse Passage...</strong>
<P>[The poetic Lancelot Mulliner, seemingly acquiescing to his uncle Mr. Briggs' desire that he accept employment in his pickle factory.]
<P>&quot;I still consider that slicing up cucumbers and dipping them in vinegar is a poor life-work for a man with the Promethean fire within him; but I propose to place at the disposal of the Briggs Breakfast Pickle my poetic gifts.&quot; &quot;Well, that's better than nothing. I've just been correcting the proofs of the last thing our man turned in. It's really excellent. Listen:
<P>'Soon, soon all human Joys must end: Grim Death approaches with his sickle: Courage! There is still time, my friend, To eat a Briggs's Breakfast Pickle.' If you could give us something like that -&quot; Lancelot raised his eyebrows. His lip curled. &quot;The little thing I have dashed off is not quite like that.&quot; &quot;Oh, you've written something, eh?&quot; &quot;A mere morceau. You would care to hear it?&quot; &quot;Fire away, my boy.&quot; Lancelot produced his manuscript and cleared his throat. He began to read in a low, musical voice.
<P>&quot;DARKLING (A Threnody) BY L. BASSINGTON MULLINER (Copyright in all languages, including the Scandinavian) (The dramatic, musical-comedy, and motion-picture rights of this Threnody are strictly reserved. Applications for these should be made to the author)&quot; &quot;What is a Threnody?&quot; asked Mr Briggs. &quot;This is,&quot; said Lancelot. He cleared his throat again and resumed. &quot;Black branches, Like a corpse's withered hands, Waving against the blacker sky: Chill winds, Bitter like the tang of half-remembered sins; Bats wheeling mournfully through the air, And on the ground Worms, Toads, Frogs, And nameless creeping things; And all around Desolation, Doom, Dyspepsia, And Despair. I am a bat that wheels through the air of Fate; I am a worm that wriggles in a swamp of Disillusionment; I am a despairing toad; I have got dyspepsia.&quot; He paused. His uncle's eyes were protruding rather like those of a nameless creeping frog.
<P>(Excerpt from &quot;Came the Dawn&quot; (1927), by P. G. Wodehouse)
