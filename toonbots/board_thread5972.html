<strong>Golf - not just a good walk spoiled</strong>
<P>Pace Mark Twain, my seven-year-old has been teaching me golf and y'know, it's a damn fun game. We usually get about two or three times par but we have a great time doing it, and for six more bucks you get to drive a golf cart.
<P>What could go wrong?
<P>Well, if you've ever watched my boy on a driving software game (yes, this is a clumsy rhetorical device, as I know for a fact that none of you has done so) well, you will immediately realize that this boy is not the one you want at the wheel while careening madly down a Bloomington hill, say, on the 4th hole of the Quarry course. Just sayin'. I don't *think* it was due to his driving that the cart stopped working, but, um, they coincided.
<P>Thank God he didn't jam the parking brake on to slow down. He would have flipped the cart for sure; they're not really made to go ninety miles an hour on the straightaway.
<P>But seriously -- golf is easy to play badly (which we do) and still fun if you're playing badly, unlike, say, basketball, where there is a certain minimum skill level to actually start enjoying it -- at least, here in Indiana where everybody but me was born with a basketball in his hands.
<P>Go figure. I'm the only guy on the course with a ponytail and sandals, though. Ha. Even in Bloomington there are standards, apparently.
