<strong>Does anybody find this funny?</strong>
<P>I don't know why, but the 6/23 episode makes me laugh. Usually I have at least a glimmering of why I like episodes, but this one came out more randomly than most, and ... well ... there it is.
<P>So anyway, I'm thinking of buying an RV and a two-way satellite modem and seeing America. All of it. Down to, like, the Panama Canal. My wife's latest plan is to book passage on the QE2 from LA to Sydney after obtaining a year's teaching job in Australia somewhere, then teach for the year, then take the QE2 to Japan, and teach for a year, then take the QE2 to South Africa, then teach for a year .... I'm not sure how long she intends to do this, but it sounds attractive. I guess we'd eventually end up in New York or LA, then have to start the whole world over from scratch.
<P>Her earlier idea was to drive to Brazil, but it turned out there's 100 km of the Pan-American Highway that hasn't been built yet, in Panama just before you get to Colombia. And probably won't, either, since it would have to go through -- and demolish -- some pristine rain forest. So driving to South America is kind of problematic. Darn. I thought that was one of her better ideas, too.

<P>&gt; I don't know why, but the 6/23 episode makes me laugh.
<P>And now I read it again -- and I laughed again! WHY?!?!?

<strong>Re: Does anybody find this funny?</strong>
<P>&gt; And now I read it again -- and I laughed again! WHY?!?!?
<P>Perhaps because, from Sheik Usama (may he be blotted out)'s own point of view, the call of Global Corporatism (may it be blotted out) is indeed the Dark Side, indeed the latest form of the great enemy R\-um... but indeed seductive in its wealth?
<P>Other than that, I dunno. I could say something about `just making sense' again, but by now we surely know the fruits of such thoughts...

<strong>Re: Does anybody find this funny?</strong>
<P>well, i've looked at it a couple times, and it's growing on me - but it's not knock-out funny, somehow.
<P>of course i was also distracted by the thought of you careening around the continents in an rv. myself, i would definitely go the luxury-liner route.
