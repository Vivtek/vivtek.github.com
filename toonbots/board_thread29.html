<strong>Changing Gradients?</strong>
<P>Is it just me, or did Michael alter the cartoon? I seem to remember all three panels being gradients, but I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't an illusion created by sleep-dep, or somesuch.

<P>Heh -- I wondered if you'd notice. You were the only person to have seen the first panel as a gradient. The second panel didn't change. I was diddling around with color and decided the strip looked a lot better with the first panel black, because then it all suggested kind of a dawn, black to gray to the gradient.
<P>So I changed it.

<P>I'm going to have to start going through some kind of random proxy just to keep you from tracking me like that.

<P>Try it, punk. I eat 133t k1dd13z like you for breakfast. Besides, even if you weren't running that weird browser, there was only one hit before I changed the strip. It's hard to blend into a crowd of one.

<strong>Re: Changing Gradients?</strong>
<P>Oops. Forgot, not too many people wander in here randomly, do they? I was thinking about just using mangled http headers, or lynx and wget from other locations, but I now see that it wouldn't do me much good. I need to get some more people reading this thing.

<P>You know, the really, really frightening thing about Toonbots is that I *do* see people return. I think there's a really deep-seated need for sequential graphics in our society, and Webtoons fill that need.... Even kind-of ones like Toonbots. It's still graphical, and I guess that's enough.
<P>Weird.
