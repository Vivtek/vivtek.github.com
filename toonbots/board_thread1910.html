<strong>well...?</strong>
<P>Can't fault your stuff for not being different. I'll take a peek at the rest of the archives another time. Most of this is woshing right over my head at light speed, but that's probably because i'm too dang tired.
<P>You know what I find annoying, that people can't seem to work up the amount of passion over substantive issues as they can when they start and perticipate in some stupid Flame war.
<P>I dispise and loath flame wars by the way.
<P>Take Care DFG

<P>Well, in that case... *defenestrates Madame Fan Girl through approximately 42.314159 windows, all arranged in a delicate spiral over a large chasm*
<P>It had to be done.

<P>Sorry, DFG -- Napoleon is indeed the Jihad's High Chancellor of Defenestration. It's only the unwary who even consider flaming her.

<strong>Re: well...?</strong>
<P>&gt; Can't fault your stuff for not being different.
<P>DFG wins the Understatement of the Year Award. Thanks for stopping by, and believe me, it's only the ... occasional person who finds Toonbots to their taste. Very occasional, according to my logs. (Maybe something faster than a 16-day update periodicity will help...)
<P>&gt; I'll take a peek at the
<BR>> rest of the archives another time.
<P>Start from the start, though. Otherwise it won't ... well, it still won't make sense, but maybe you'll be too numb to notice.
<P>&gt; You know what I find annoying, that people can't seem to work up the
<BR>> amount of passion over substantive issues as they can when they start and
<BR>> perticipate in some stupid Flame war.
<P>... I [i]do[/i] work up passion over substantive issues. I'm a Quaker. It's endemic. Drives my wife crazy. A couple of months ago she told me I'm getting nuttier than ever; I think I'd just gone into a tirade about the theft of a certain high national executive office *coff*theOvalOffice*coff* -- as a non-citizen of the US, I think she really just didn't care so much.
<P>Just so you don't categorize me as an *empty* flamer. I'm also an antispammer, a tax reform activist, and I rant about bad movie endings. All kinds of bad habits -- but I *don't* criticize hobbyist cartoonists. Well, I suppose it would be an odd thing for me to do. But I don't criticize hobbyist programmers, either. Unless one has just wrested a job away from me, I suppose. And I do have a .. *thing* for enterprise IT people who label themselves &quot;coders.&quot; Jeesh. But I don't crash their bars and criticize them in public, either, then try to pass it off as comedy.
