<strong>Re: ToonBotSpace</strong>
<P>Look, Mr. Martin, clearly it would have been better for me to ignore the thing, and I apologize. I really don't try to offend people, but while it was an original idea, I just became a trifle annoyed about it. I apologize, and have already deleted my comments from the forum in question, but I was trying to be fairly polite about it, and it was unnecessary for you to go out of your way to poke fun of me in this manner.
<P>Would be genuinely interested in your thoughts on Toonbots, though, as I've been curious as to what others outside of the Jihad think of it

<P>Oh, but wait, Brother Emsworth. If this was directed against you, then (1) I, for one, would like to hear the rest .. of the story, and (2) more than likely a defenestration request would be in order.

<strong>Re: ToonBotSpace</strong>
<P>Ow, I can't believe I was just thrown through a window. It was a rush though.
<P>My original post here was completely for Emsworth's amusement. I assumed he was amused as he referred to it on another aformentioned forum as quite a minimalist feat. It had no other intention, normally I amuse myself but that one was for you, I took some time typing that too. ;)
<P>Secondly I think ToonBots is cool, and it is cool to see some popular comics recognize it because otherwise it would be easily lost and unappreciated. It's even got some funny episodes... and a Boxjam cameo? Can't wait till I can do my comic with it.
<P>So, what have I learned here? I learned that the plural of forum is apparently fora. That's really cool. I'm going to go check out some other fora now.
<P>Your fellow toonist, Tyler Martin

<P>Very well, since the meta-cartoonist has requested it. You may have noticed that Mr. Martin has been posting &quot;Keenspace&quot; online-hosting parodies in several fora as a rather unique self-promotion gimmick. I really shouldn't have said anything about it, as it really wasn't much of a big deal, but it was beginning to annoy me just a trifle, so I commented in the &quot;ChoppingSpace&quot; thread in the &quot;Chopping Block&quot; forum. In reply to a couple &quot;What the---?&quot; responses, assuming (rightly or wrongly) that those who posted might have been wondering what it was about, I stated, more or less, that I'd already noticed that Mr. Martin had pulled the same prank in at least 8 other fora. I said that it was amusing enough at first, but hoped that he didn't intend to try that in every forum in Keenspace and Keenspot (and added, rather unwisely, that at least the Toonbots forum would be safe, as it couldn't support HTML codes.) I later removed those comments, after noting a rude reply in that forum, and shortly before seeing this thread here. I assumed at first that Mr. Martin had posted this in retaliation, particularly as he mentioned me specifically.
<P>I think I over-reacted, and took the whole thing too seriously. Perhaps I was wrong. Although I've been posting to message boards for a few months now, I still worry a bit about whether I'm expressing myself clearly and politely, or whether I've inadvertently insulted someone or made a particularly foolish statement.
<P>However, with other people, I can not always be sure if they intended for their statements to be taken literally, or were being intentionally rude, or were merely intended as a friendly joke. I have on more than one occasion embarrassed myself by taking such statements literally, and posting a serious reply to what subsequently turned out to be a facetious suggestion. I've always been a bit literal minded, and have sometimes had similar problems communicating in real life, but it seems to be even worse for me on the internet. Ah, well. Sorry for going on like this, and I'd like to forget the whole thing if possible.

<P>Psha. (1) Nothing's real on the Internet and (2) nothing is ever forgotten, either! MWUHahahahahaaa!!! (Actually I'm kinda flattered that Tyler came over, and his solution was pretty darned ingenious if you ask me.)
<P>Relax, Emsworth. It's all in fun.

<strong>Re: ToonBotSpace</strong>
<P>&gt; Relax, Emsworth. It's all in fun.
<P>Sorry. As you may or may not have guessed by now, I'm a rather highly strung individual with a tendency towards paranoia, and much as I've come to enjoy message board posting, I still worry about it. And really, having seen some rather disturbing discussions in certain Keenspot Boards (and a handful in Keenspace), I do get the idea that it is not always in fun, as some individuals do seem to bear grudges and can be very obnoxious. These individuals also tend to be incoherent and have bad grammer, however. While Mr. Martin displayed neither, I don't know him well enough to know whether or not he bore me any animosity and that this wasn't intended maliciously (though I suppose he may have thought the same thing about mny remarks, but I was trying to be polite, really; I suppose I'm too easily irritated.)
<P>Besides, so many of the individuals who, throughout my elementary and high school years, heckled and irritated me in various ways (claimed to be &quot;just kidding&quot; or that &quot;it's all a joke, don't take thing so seriously,&quot; or &quot;you need to lighten up, man.&quot; I'm ranting again, aren't I? Oh, well. Sorry for going on like this, and I'll just try not to take such things so seriously from now on.
<P>On a brighter, Toonbots related note, I like the new dropdown, with the &quot;Too cool for Keen&quot; slogan. I finally had time to go through Napoleon's archives, in fact, and it's quite a good strip (and no offense, Mr. Roberts, but it has the very slight advantage of having some semblance of a plot; besides, the snail's cute.)
<P>

<P>Oh, *fine*. Now we see which side the bread's buttered on. Well, the Dot's fed up, too. I'm working on ... things. You'll see.
