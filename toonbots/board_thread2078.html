<BR>> It's always surprising how fairly simple rules can have such unexpected
<BR>> emergent results.
<P>I'm going on vacation next week though. I bet I come back and I've been wiped totally off the board.
<P>I think I'm on first just cause the whole bottom of the board right now is from before I got the nerve to click the frightening 'forum here, are you blind' button. Ah, how I've grown and changed. I go back and look at my photo album from last month and just snicker at how young I was. Oh, look! My first defenestration! My first membership card! Gwendolyn eating the card! The trip to the doctor's to get my fingers sewn back on! My second membership card!
<P>Ah, the memories....

<strong>Re: Standings</strong>
<P>&gt; oh wow...there were rules?
<P>There are rules for how the threads expire. At midnight each day, if there are more than 256 posts on the board, the Cursed Thread Reaper awakes. One thread is pruned, always the one which has the least recent final posting.
<P>Since the number of posts in a thread is usually large (more than 10 or so) that means that the number of posts active on the board approximate a monthly running average indicator of board activity. The standings approximate the active posting behavior of the Jihad over the last couple of months. If somebody was really active a couple of months ago but has since SLACKED OFF (ahem) then their standings may drop precipitously.
<P>That's what I meant.

<P>so does this mean i could dominate the standings by hanging on like grim death to one thread, extending its life beyond all that is natural and good by repeated chantlike postings (using the mystical number of 256!), thus converting it into an zombie-like berserker, and sweeping all before me to destruction and oblivion?

<P>That could *theoretically* work, but remember that the Cursed Thread Reaper works for Michael, and tends to delegate upward rather quickly when people try to subvert him. You'd eventually end up with a wolverine Irony Squad filling up your place of residence with printouts of your postings, and setting them on fire.

<P>::wolverines growl and procede to cautiously nibble at the mouse, who Usu suspects may taste like chicken ::
<P>Ahem. Speaking as the Jihad's long-standing wolverine wrangler (with Napoleon as proxy wolverine handler, and primary breeder), I'd like to think that the wolverines would not too soon forget which Jihad members have cared and nurtured them (or even depicted them in fan strips) for so long. Plus paeans (even meta-fictional ones) are rarely edible, and far from substantial (Usu is a growing wolverine, after all.)

<P>lets see: if i run my paean through spanish i get:

<P>sorta beats up the rhyme scheme but that 'wolverines of or...wolverines noble of or'...that speaks to me somehow. (altho the wolverines might object to all that snoring). this has possibilities - lets see about French:
<P>the wolverines of or, of the wolverines of whirr-whirr or the whirr of the whirr of the whirr of the whirr, the dum-dum one of the dum of the dum of the whirr of the whirr of the whirr of the whirr of the whirr of the whirr, the dum of the dum of the dum of the dum, segÃ..Ã.Âºn the sight in the dum of the dum of the dum of the dum of the compartments, noble of wolverines of or

<P>better stop here - my office mate is starting to wonder why i keep snorting.

<P>My friend who went on an outing with the Flash Photographers, Small Explosive Manufacturers, Lovers of Bright Shiny Things, Circus Sparkler Concessionaries, &amp; cie., said that the penguins fell way over backwards when his flight went overhead. Maybe the fact that the camera people chose that moment to take pictures, the engine caught fire, a large box of magnesium flares sought company with a lit fuse, the circus sparklers went spinning with a THWIPPSPORT! sound, and the lovers of bright shiny things were much content before everyone who didn't go up in a huge but very bright and impressive ball of light and smoke had to be rushed to the nearest base hospital had something to do with that, though...

<strong>Re: Standings</strong>
<P>&gt; There are rules for how the threads expire. At midnight each day, if there
<BR>> are more than 256 posts on the board, the Cursed Thread Reaper awakes. One
<BR>> thread is pruned, always the one which has the least recent final posting.
<P>This brings up something which I'd meant to mention earlier:
<P>There was a single-post thread from February 14 (&quot;Propaganda,&quot; posted by Michael) which was never reaped until just recently, even though threads which were more recent by a matter of months were routinely reaped. Did you set the reaper script to ignore that post, or is it just a bug... it's been nagging at me for some reason.

<P>Something got out of whack there; I don't know what. I finally just deleted it by hand.
