<strong>Who Won?</strong>
<P>So... who won the &quot;cool enough&quot; award for th 29th?
<P>If nobody: then the new feature for the toon-o-matic is FONTS, specifically:
<P>[caption font=&quot;ocraext&quot; location=&quot;bottom middle&quot; size=&quot;26&quot;]
<P>font=&quot;ocraext&quot; is a specific font declaration. The location already existed, as did the size... I think. Yes, yes it did, becuase you used it in another epsiode prior.
<P>If'n I'm too late, I won't be surprised. But as I saw no other posts, I figured what the hell.
<P>

<P>Nobody, including you.
<P>&gt; If nobody: then the new feature for the toon-o-matic is FONTS,
<BR>> specifically:
<P>That was the new feature for the 28th, but what really cool rendering feature first appeared on the 29th?

<BR>> figured what the hell.
<P>Chris already tried with the font issue. Come on, come on.

<P>Uh, caption size.

<P>Nope, that's old. A casual glance through the archives shows a size of 68 on March 30, but font size was one of the things I first implemented with captions.
<P>So... steeerike two!

<P>Is it the combination of the aspect and facing propery? (aspect=&quot;2 faceleft&quot;) I don't remember seeing them together like that before.

<P>No. Um... I'm not sure I actually ever used it before, but it's been in the code for quite a while.
<P>Dang. I really thought this was obvious. It is to me. And in the end, you're all going to say, &quot;Oh, *that*? Sheesh. You geek.&quot;

<P>Now that I look at the comic again, it does seem embarrassingly obvious, which is probably why none of us got it.
<P>CAPTION WORD WRAPPING.
<P>...right?

<P>ACK Crap. I didn't even see that. I was looking at the darn CODE and not the actual strip for new stuff. Not that I didn't already look at the strip and all... heh.
<P>-=I=- should've freakin got that since you'd all but advertised the fact that you were going to do it when you fixed up my fan XML. *BONK*
