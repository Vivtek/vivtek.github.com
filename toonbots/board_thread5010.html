<strong>Must .. stop .. reading .. news</strong>
<P>Sorry, all, just as I was getting back on my metaphorical feet after the return to the House of Mold (ozone -- it's not just for the stratosphere any more!) I got sucked into the maw of the Liberal Blogosphere again. But never fear; my mother just told me just now to stop it. It only makes me depressed, and keeps me from working and from doing things I actually enjoy, like maybe some new Toonbots. I've had a couple of mildly jocular notions lately. If I can just ignore the outside world a little better, I should be able to do something about them.
<P>For years, I had the opinion that if anything important happened, somebody would tell me about it. I need to stick with that.

<P>mothers are really good for stuff like that.....

<P>yes! yes! yes! jocularity! jocularity!

<P>i suppose we could all promise to tell you....but in the meantime, just look for the big mushroom cloud. anything else is probably insignificant, in the long run...

<P>Have you been watching &quot;M*A*S*H*&quot; of late, my dear rodent?
<P>Although I don't consider myself an isolationist and am all in favor of keeping informed, I feel that there are enough worries, circumstances, events, and people in one's one life to depress one without allowing one's self to read of other people's stupidity or political rants in general.

<P>i've got M*A*S*H _memorized_, baby.

<P>well, it's true that there's generally enough grief to go around - but politics can be amusing, too. not so much lately....but it's _possible_.

<P>&quot;It's nice to be nice to the nice.&quot;
<P>&quot;Horse hockey pucks!&quot;
<P>&quot;Klinger is riding on Sophie... and they're both naked!&quot;
<P>Chris and I have often lamented that Col. Sam &quot;I am the wind&quot; Flagg never received his own spin-off. According to most accounts, would have been more interesting than &quot;AfterM*A*S*H.&quot;
<P>One of my lasting regrets is missing a touring production of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;... starring Jamie Farr as Oscar and William Christopher as Felix. (To say nothing of seeing the pair as hippies in &quot;With Six You Get Eggroll.&quot;)

<P>now, &quot;the odd couple&quot; i can totally see - but as hippies...... - ok, 1968 - they might have pulled that off then - oh my, and with george carlin to help them, yet! this must be on video, somewhere....
