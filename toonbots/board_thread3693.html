<strong>and peeps!</strong>
<P>i like to stock up on them this time of year, and then let them dry out a bit so the outside is a bit crunchy. peeps are better because they have no calories (because of all the air that goes into the marshmallow)

<strong>Marshmallow chickies and bunnies!</strong>
<P>Had 4 packages of yellow Peep chickies last year. Took forever to finish them all. This year, only had one package, consisting of white bunny Peeps. One reminds, sitting there all alone, gazing forlornly into the vast empty space which is his existence, poor thing. I'll probably eat him later this evening. The mater didn't have enough funds this year for the post-Easter candy sales, sadly, and is a tad disgruntled about the fact that there are still vast quantities of Tootsie Rolls and Tootsie Roll Pops from the after Halloween sales.

<BR>> them all.
<P>this is what i'm saying - they're best when older and more crunchy (if you open the package a bit, they get that way faster.
<P>&gt; This year, only had one package, consisting of white bunny
<BR>> Peeps.
<P>wow - white? don't think i've ever seen them in such native coloration...

<P>gad, i hope so....you aren't even giving him jelly beans for company?
<P>&gt; there are still vast quantities of Tootsie Rolls and Tootsie Roll
<BR>> Pops from the after Halloween sales.
<P>*sigh* - the ability to allow candy to remain uneaten....afraid it is a sign of advancing age and maturity (that, or your recent injuries prevented you from getting to them - glad you are out again, btw.) although personally i could never get much into tootsie roll pops - something about that dark orb, lurking within the colorful candy shell and shadowing the bright colors with it's stolid density. (wow - you must be catching)

<P>Well, we removed most of them and placed them in a glass candy jar soon after purchase. This year, just put them in a resealable plastic bag.
<P>&gt; wow - white? don't think i've ever seen them in such native coloration...
<P>Which is why the mater purchased them. Last year, could only find pink bunnies.
<P>&gt; gad, i hope so....you aren't even giving him jelly beans for company?
<P>Sadly, we have no jelly beans either. The Peeps were the only Easter candies purchased this year. However, suppose he can exchange grievances with the raspberry Tootsie Roll Pops.

<BR>> sign of advancing age and maturity (that, or your recent injuries
<BR>> prevented you from getting to them - glad you are out again, btw.)
<P>Also the result of purchasing three to five sacks of Tootsie Roll Pops, and I forget how many bags of Tootsie Rolls. As for my current status, started using a cane a couple days ago, which makes it much easier to carry things or fetch the mail. Still concerned about the arm, though (be at least another month before full range of motion is regained, if not longer, at present rate.)

<strong>The passing of a peep...</strong>
<P>Today, the last surviving peep bunny fulfilled his destiny. Air had got into the bag, so he was a tad hard, but still adorably edible. Nice and sugary. I'll miss his stoic expression, though.

<P>wow - and i just bought mine. (relatively restrained purchase - 1 box of bunnies (pink) and two of chicks (classic yellow and new electric blue - i may regret that) -$0.24/box - bless target's after-easter sales! also found (but passed up) some disturbing pseudo-peeps (even though they were chocolate-filled) - with bright red combs, but no eyes (and no beaks - actually not much of a head at all). tempted to go back to get some more and try peep-jousting, except that devoting time to such activities would probably consitute final proof that My Life is Irretrievably Pathetic - so better stick to waiting till the peeps get slightly crunchy and indulging in a quiet peep orgy.
