<strong>michael - you gotta have this one</strong>
<P>(i'm assuming you can pick up pictures off the 'net) http://channels.netscape.com/ns/news/story.jsp?floc=NW_3-T&amp;oldflok=FF-RTO-rontz&amp;idq=/ff/story/0002%2F20030724%2F180390893.htm&amp;sc=rontz&amp;photoid=20030724WHT305DR (sorry about the length of the address).
<P>the picture has, apparently, no bearing on the story - but it's a natural for the toon-o-matic's bush collection.

<P>My God, it came this close! I thought fer sure we were under attack again!
<P>You! Yeah, you -- why haven't we found that Osama dude yet?
<P>I want a full report on my desk in an hour, with yours and Osama's heads next to it!

<P>Ahem. My ultra charming husband walked past and said, &quot;It looks like he's about to go down on you.&quot;
<P>Apologies for breaking the family friendly format here. :)

<P>You forgot to tell her to count her fingers! I've always found that to be very important, as they're very difficult to reattach when they've been in a wolverine stomach for very long.

<P>Well, I was assuming she'd be adopting the velvet hand in the iron glove procedure, or simply leave the room until the wolverines are finished.

<strong>Re: Very important!</strong>
<P>i find holding my hands up in the air, and watching the proceedings from the top of the refrigerator, works fine.
<P>and i decided the wireless mouse was probably going to be prone to problems anyway....but it sounded like they got it down to pretty small pieces before they swallowed it, so i think all will be well.

<strong>Wireless mouse</strong>
<P>it occurs to me to wonder if they'll now be able to draw things on the screen in the course of their insouciant space-filling wanderings.
<P>mouse (wireless as well, but i presume not the object of their ministrations -- you _were_ perched well out of harm's way, no?), have you observed any such correlated motions in the time since?

<P>well, there _have_ been a few random blips - but i think the wolverine-to-screen orientation is critical. certain angles, the signal just doesn't get through.
