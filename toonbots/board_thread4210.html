<strong>Good spam?!?</strong>
<P>Yes, for the first time in my life I have received spam which I actually appreciated receiving. It was from Korea, advertising a ship-for-sale database. Did you know that for around a million dollars you can buy a working cargo ship? Wouldn't that be cool? My wife would be captain, my kids would be the crew foremen, we could have a big mad-genius workshop for the robotics experiments and the hydroponics lab and the underwater self-propelled sensory platforms for searching for sunken treasure, I'd have satellite broadband (pricing is coming down all the time!) and a nice big computer room right off the bridge. And a ready room, too, because you have to be able to say, &quot;Number One, you have the bridge, I'll be in my ready room.&quot;
<P>And we'd just tool around the world taking stuff from point A to point B. What could be cooler than that? And we could retrofit for sail! Automated sail, of course, cutting edge all the way for us. Did you know a typical ship capable of going like 12 miles per hour uses 7.5 tons of diesel fuel a day? Sail *has* to be cheaper.
<P>Why would anybody buy a big house in the burbs when they could be in cargo shipping? I don't get it! My wife's already filling out the loan papers, I think. Her idea is adventure cruises. I like that idea, too. There are lots of geeks who'd like to go places off the beaten path, in a ship with a functional LAN so you could plug your laptop into the wall and get to the satellite uplink for your mail. Personally I think that drive-on, drive-off RV transport to Europe would be a winner. Kind of like a cruise ship, except you bring your own cabin.
<P>Oh, the possibilities are endless. Who wouldn't want their own ship? Yeah, spam can be good. Very, very occasionally.

<P>guess this makes you No. 1 - always remember, it's the _captain's_ ready room.
<P>&gt; Did you know a typical

<P>good lord - probably faster, too.
<P>&gt; Oh, the possibilities are endless. Who wouldn't want their own ship? Yeah,
<BR>> spam can be good. Very, very occasionally.
<P>be sure to check the size of the thing - some of them are a bit hard to park. (many of them, however, are large enough that the crew patrols them on bicycle - built in exercise regime!)
<P>now the important question is - how come _i_ never get spam like this?

<strong>Re: Good spam?!?</strong>

<P>I feel the same way. All I ever get is &quot;Men Will Notice Your Cleavage!!!&quot; or &quot;Free Porn Password!!!&quot; or &quot;Reduce Your Mortgage&quot; (which I don't mind as much as the others.) Also, an inordinate number of people seem to think I want Viagra. Listen, you blighters, I haven't even been on so much as a date yet, all right?

<strong>Plumbing and cleavage</strong>
<P>&gt; hey - _emsworth_ brought it up....
<P>Ahem. But it was not my felicity of expression which gave the meta-cartoonist an undesirable mental image (though it failed to create any images for me, but the turn of phrase was decidedly neat and amused me more than somewhat.)

<P>*sigh* this is where i reveal my great age, and admit that the picture came to me from memories of the old &quot;saturday night&quot; lisa lubner sketchs, several of which featured dan ackroyd as a plumber, the weight of whose tool belt gave him a....shall we say, distinctive...ah...&quot;rear view&quot;.
<P>still, glad it was amusing.

<P>Duh. Mechanic and mad scientist. And navigator.

<BR>> on bicycle - built in exercise regime!)
<P>For around a million, you're looking at a cargo ship maybe 300 feet long, 60 wide, and 20 deep not including any superstructure. Hard to park indeed, which is why ports were invented.
<P>&gt; now the important question is - how come _i_ never get spam like this?
<P>I get a lot of spam. Sooner or later there was bound to be something mildly interesting in it.

<P>When I first saw the subject, I thought you had taken leave of your senses. (Perfectly understandable, of course.)
<P>I know see that you are exercising a finely honed sarcasm that was an immense pleasure to read.
<P>Either that, or you *really* need to take a break.
<P>Peace, Tim Bram.

<P>Well, I do indeed need a break, but not being independently wealthy, I guess that just isn't going to happen. But I do think it'd be neat to own and run a cargo ship. And my wife really is crazy about the idea.
