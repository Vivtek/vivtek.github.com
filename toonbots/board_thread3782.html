<P>&gt; Cool!
<P>What ho! Certainly not averse to the return of &quot;Iron Shamrock.&quot; Uncertain about this new strip, though having just gone through the few archived strips, would say that it can be better described as goofy than dark, apart from the skeleton and black voo-doo doll or whatever he is. Bizarre at times and mildly unnerving, perhaps, but not really dark.

<P>So sue me, I can't think of the right adjective to characterize my reaction -- &quot;dark&quot; was the first thing I came up with in a hurry. The skeleton is cool. The fat man eating mayonnaise gives me the heeby-jeebies.
<P>...
<P>Does it occur to anyone that any description of nd's work tends to sound made-up? &quot;Yes, yes, the electromagnets were excellent, but the fat man eating mayonnaise and the little girl on the moon were too strange for my taste. I'd like to see a return of the forty-foot spider.&quot;

<P>um... a secret about the fat guy eating mayonaise... those were filler from random bits i did for a friend. He will never return. so jump up and down for joy. when I get far enough ahead with the strips, i'm removing those from the archive. And they made my readership drop down to 10% as well. Live and learn.
<P>---
<P>and it all sounds made up to me. of course, I was the one making it up...

<P>I'm reluctant to ask exactly why your friend would be amused by mysterious obese men eating mayonnaise. Still, all according to taste, I suppose.

<P>::wolverines jump up and down and eat the rest of the mayonnaise::

<P>Pardon, but if you don't mind my asking, exactly where *is* this new venture, if I may ask? This was the first I'd heard of it. A quick glance at the old &quot;Iron Shamrock&quot; page revealed a notice regarding the new strip, but no link.

<P>Harrumph. I'm not the one who came up with that translation. Not sure if your Spanish skills are rustier than mine, or more likely, you're being deliberately obtuse, but the original meaning is as follows: &quot;Your pants are on fire! Hey! Many monkeys are dead in a butchershop in Butte, Montana!&quot;
<P>Makes only marginally more sense than the other, but at least it has nothing to do with mononeucleosis.

<P>ooh, that's fun - saves all the bother of typing things in over and over.
<P>babelfish is actually pretty good at simple tasks (such as 'here is the hotel'), and will give you a basic idea of more complicated sentences (if you limit yourself to one interation) so you at least have _some_ idea of what's going on - so it is a handy thing.
<P>but some days its more fun just to make it up yourself.
