<strong>Serenity -- logarithmic scale, anyone?</strong>
<P>No point in doing numeric scores anymore; you all know I get too exuberant whenever I actually get to see a movie nowadays.
<P>Serenity was fantastic. I didn't get to see it on the big screen, unfortunately, instead renting it last night on DVD. It deserves all the good stuff I've heard about it -- I was happy to see that it is just plain solid science-fiction, something you rarely see in a non-print format.
<P>I particularly liked the rich characterization. The effects sequences were sadly short, but beautiful while they lasted. The whole glory-of-spaceflight thing is definitely there.
<P>Kind of like Star Wars could have been, really.
<P>If you haven't seen it, see it.

<P>Seems you've been seeing an awful lot of movies lately, some even in theaters! (I did see &quot;Cars,&quot; but other than that, I'm making my way through the growing mound of VHS from Hollywood Video clearance sales, 3 bucks for everything; got through a lot of Muppet stuff, a bad Charlie Chan [even by bad Charlie Chan standards], and started on &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;; &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; and W.C. Fields' &quot;David Copperfield&quot; are next).
<P>And don't forget, your one year anniversary of nonstop hiatus is coming up! Since Defenestration Day was depressing, lets at least do something to celebrate the continued non-existence of Toonbots except in our hearts!

<strong>Re: Serenity</strong>

<BR>> theaters!
<P>Indeed I have, and it's been very nice indeed. Oh, wait, I saw Cars, too. Thanks for reminding me.
<P>We've been seeing movies for a couple of reasons: my sister took us to see Cars because she wanted to see it with my son (who, no surprise, is well-known in the family for really liking Hot Wheels). And my daughter is a real X-Men fan, so we had to see that. So we took our son to see Over The Hedge as his own movie, because X-Men would hardly have been appropriate for him. (That's not a namby-pamby kind of &quot;not for children&quot; assessment, just a cold, hard knowledge of his personality -- he's more of a bunnies-and-butterflies kind of person.) (And Hot Wheels and Transformers, but that's a different question.)
<P>&gt; &quot;The Blues
<BR>> Brothers&quot;;
<P>Got that in AVI format now, thank you, along with a few other 80's titles (Ferris Buehler, Ghostbusters, etc.) BitTorrent is nice. I have The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly downloaded, too.
<P>&gt; And don't forget, your one year anniversary of nonstop hiatus is coming
<BR>> up! Since Defenestration Day was depressing, lets at least do something to
<BR>> celebrate the continued non-existence of Toonbots except in our hearts!
<P>Well, maybe I'll de-hiatus at some point. It all depends on what the Muse decides.

<P>So you say. At this point, I think you're just a sadist and like adding to our continuing mental anguish. You neither update nor do you officially abandon the comic, like Nappy did with &quot;Snail Dust.&quot; You just let it fester and attract tree sloths and echidnas.

<P>my oatmeal is served only with brown sugar and buttermilk (or butter and maple syrup, if i'm feeling decadent), and i equally oppose eggs of any sort in my stew.
<P>with some nice hash browns and bacon though....

<P>Well *that* ain't going to change. I'm not a sadist, and I officially apologize for any continuing, ongoing, or occasional anguish, whether mental or physical, temporary or permanent, experienced by any poster, reader, or peruser of these fora, whether titled, incidental, or anonymous, or penguins. OR PENGUINS, I tell you!
<P>Emsworth, the Muse works on its own pace. My overall priority list works like this. For any minute, the flowchart looks like:
<P>1. Is there translation work outstanding and is there &quot;translation capacity&quot; in my brain? If so, do 400 to 600 words of translation, about 40 minutes of work.
<P>2. Is there technical work outstanding and is there &quot;technical capacity&quot; in my brain? If so, open ssh window and stare at it for 1 hour, while reading boingboing.net.
<P>3. Is there news I haven't read? If so, read news for 30 minutes.
<P>4. Is there invoicing to do? If so, fail to do invoicing for 1 hour.
<P>5. Is there a bill to pay? If so, feel adrenaline about not invoicing. Pay the bill tomorrow.
<P>6. Does my wife want to see a movie? If so, see a movie.
<P>7. Relax for 5 minutes. If Muse strikes, do whatever the Muse commands. If not, go to 1.
<P>The good news is that the Muse has been pretty damned active the past week or two. The bad news is that it's been normal textual science fiction instead of Toonbots. The good news is that I think it's pretty good stuff -- I like it, anyway. The bad news is that it's completely unpublishable in any way ever connectable to my actual identity, because the whole thing started out as a sexual fantasy last year. It was getting somewhat tiring in my head, so I decided to put it on paper. It worked great -- once externalized, it was less like a song I couldn't get out of my head, and more like some kind of Chalkeresque reading. It sat gathering dust on my hard drive until a couple of weeks ago, for some reason, I reread it. It was pretty good writing, or at least I liked it. And then the Muse decided to kick in. It's now up to 17,000 words and it's more like actual science fiction instead of, you know, trashy Internet pr0nfic. But it still betrays its origins. Maybe a good editor could help me convert it into something I could safely be associated with in public. I dunno.
<P>Or maybe the Muse, now that it's finally musing a little, will switch back to something I can show y'all. Cross your fingers.

<P>You should check Craig's List. Way back, the Playboy Radio Network (yes there is such a thing) and others were advertising for good erotic science fiction. To me, eroticism and radio drama is a strange combination which could lead to disturbing Lone Ranger fanfic (a masked man and his faithful Indian companion, alone with only the woods and the soundmen and coconuts), but there you go.

<P>You know, I thought about that. I don't think it would work. But maybe I'll rethink it.
<P>Oddly, the storyline got to a quasi-stopping point, and the Muse flamed out. Maybe it'll go on, maybe not. It's actually a nice little novella at this point, with one of those &quot;and that's how it all started&quot; endings.
<P>I'm starting to feel like the next creative burst might be software-oriented again, so I'm going to steer it towards SCUMF if possible.

<P>Steer left, lower the mainsales, pipe up the anchor, watch out for the gingerbread!
<P>My own creativity has been almost exclusively limited to the very addictive Muppet Wiki. I suspect folks here would especially enjoy these two:
<P>http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Capitalism
<P>http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Communism
<P>Plus, we've been able to trace when Kermit first became a frog, and prove that when R2-D2 was on &quot;The Muppet Show,&quot; it was a radio controlled robot and not Kenny Baker in the suit.

<P>Now *that*'s cool -- the Wilkins and Wontkins commercials remind me so much of D&amp;R Rolled Smoking Insects that I feel the urge to roll up a couple myself! Not to mention Pickle Crisp -- Party Line Coffee! Wow!
<P>Wilkins sure looks like a pre-Kermit, doesn't he? Or a green Grover, maybe.

<P>He would, but in fact Kermit predates Wilkins. The early Kermit really just became green and added flippers and collar, but he's always had the crossed eye thing.
<P>As for a green Grover, look on Muppet Wiki for Fuzzyface or &quot;Category:Character Evolution.&quot; There's some weird and wonderful stuff there. Plus a lot of people dressing as Miss Piggy, including John Ritter and Brooke Shields

<strong>Re: Serenity -- logarithmic scale, anyone?</strong>
<P>saw it the first weekend it came out - one of the few movies i've managed this year (although now i think of it, i've done better this year than i have in a while). did you ever watch the show? i was a fan of that (which is why i saw the movie so quickly). i thought it was a great followup to that, and kept the mood of the show really well. and it actually _explained_ a lot of stuff from the show, which was great.

<P>For a space Western, it could have used more horses. But the ensemble acting was good (though storyline muddled by, amongst other things, the fact that the pilot which introduced everyone and their relationships was the *last* episode to air), and I'll watch almost anything starring a &quot;Barney Miller&quot; alum at least once. Even if hash brownies are excluded.

<P>it wasn't aired last- it was like the fourth in, or something. i actually saw it on television from the first show, and i don't recall being terribly confused. but now it is available on dvd, so you can watch the episodes in their proper order. the cast was _great_, and appeared well-bonded, and it was funny and exciting and occasionally sad and had a thought-out universe behind it, and there were some neat twists in various eps.
<P>um....yeah....i sorta liked it.
