<strong>Quiet... too quiet...</strong>
<P>I spent all day catching up on the massive and convoluted threads only to have the entire board come to a screeching halt today. I'd reply to the threads below... but I don't know where to begin. SO I'll start a whole new thread WOO! Fear my lack of netiquette!
<P>- My wife's name is Dana, so the &quot;There is no Dana only ZUUL&quot; line has been uttered many-a-time at my house.
<P>- Napoleon's back! If only Snail Dust were back...
<P>- I've watched Battlefield Earth 4 times in the last week, and while my rating of it hasn't gone up (it's a mess of a movie) I find it funnier and funnier every time I watch. After reading a few great shreddings of it (Jabootu for one) I've come to appreciate how much joy I derive from hating it.
<P>That's it! I'm still patiently awaiting my rabid fandom to pay off with a O-ficial Toonbots episode. Well... mostly patiently.

<P>Probably not, but I'll join in and second the question anyway!
<P>(Wonders idly if Andrei Rublev is on TV this week...- hrm- well, The Importance of Being Earnest, with music by my fav Benjamin Frankel -is-, but it's on Premium Cable (sigh) in a few hours, and I just don't get Showtime 2.

<P>Maybe &quot;hate&quot; isn't the right word. I think the movie sucks in ways that redefine the word &quot;suck&quot;. There's so much that doesn't make sense, so much overacting and bad acting, but for some reason HBO runs it on their channels ALL THE TIME... I can guarentee that today, somewhere on the HBOs, its going to be on.
<P>Anyway, it's a MST3000 thing for me. The movie is only watchable for me if I'm making fun of it.

<strong>Re: Quiet... too quiet...</strong>
<P>&gt; ah - so it's the old &quot;there's nothing else on&quot; thing.
<P>Personally, I've had quite the opposite problem of late. A couple weeks ago, while TVLand was airing a &quot;Barney Miller&quot; marathon, I was missing the Food Network's all potato programming, and also missed the &quot;E! Hollywood Story&quot; on the Beverly Hillbillies. This week, while I've been watching &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;The Andy Griffith Show,&quot; I found I've been missing &quot;Columbo&quot; and the Peter Falk installment of &quot;Biography,&quot; amongst other things. And I still haven't had time to watch &quot;Iron Chef&quot; or tape &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog,&quot; to say nothing of missing assorted musicals or only catching portions of them on TCM. Suppose it all depends on how closely you look and where your tastes lie when it comes to television programming and whatnot.

<P>It was for one weekend only, alas. They promoted it as &quot;Couch Potato Weekend,&quot; but I saw the first commercial on Sunday afternoon, when it was already nearing a close. Pity, I'm quite partial to potatos and potato recipes. At least I got to see the Barney Miller episode where the detective squad gets high on hashish laced brownies, though.

<P>what did that have to do with potatos?
<P>oh, right - barney miller marathon.
<P>thought for a second the food network had come up with a whole slant on couch-potatoism.
<P>seriously, i should check out the food network more often. (i love the iron chef, but don't watch it religiously). still, facinating as the potato is, i'm not sure it would support a whole weekend worth of programming (unless they got into the history of the potato, and the insights it gives into incan farming methods - but then that would probably just get me all in a state wanting to try the different varieties - i can't resist new stuff)
<P>actually what i need them to do is a zucchinirama - to do something with all the zucchini i end up with. maybe now spring is here, and the zucchini are upon us...

<P>ha! actually, that's pretty close: the litany of the introductions, the dramatic music as the chefs are resurrected in a cloud of ... well, i guess it would be steam, rather than smoke, since they are in the kitchen arena and all.
<P>the play-by-play commentators are the best though - and i love the little guy who keeps breaking in with breathless announcements from the scene of the action (fukui-san! fukui-san! the challenger _is_ using sugar in the sauce!)

<P>Is it true that they've used live ingredients at times? I keep meaning to catch at least one episode before the cable is cut off. Sounds fascinating, and apparently the person serving as the chairman was also Jean ValJean in the Japanese version of &quot;Les Miserables.&quot;

<P>i've never seen one that uses live ingredients, but the intro footage has the chefs fishing live octopi out of a tank, so clearly anything is possible. (and i haven't seen all that many shows.) you really do have to see it at least once - it really has to be seen to be believed. and it's always interesting to see things from the perspective of a different culture. i saw one show involving a duel of italian chefs, and the commentator was trying to explain to the judges what ravioli is. one finally said 'oh - sort of like gyoza'. (the judges are almost always japanese, and usually things like actors or athletes or other clearly non-food-connected people. apparently the only qualification is that they like to eat.)
<P>and the chairman _is_ great - he apparently has substantial japanese acting credits (none of which i have any clue about, of course) - and he seems to have a lot of fun with the role.

<P>The film had a pleasant score as I recall, noticeable particularly in the opening titles, but apart from a few moments, doesn't really stick in my mind, as it's the dialogue and performances that I remember best. Dame Edith Evans stole every scene shw was in, reprising her stage role as Lady Bracknell (adore her intonation of &quot;A handbag??&quot;), and the great British character players Margaret Rutherford and Miles Malleson were perfectly matched as Miss Prism and Canon Chasuble. Joan Greenwood was tart as usual as Gwendolyn, and the rest of the performances were quite good. Shame they trimmed most of the exchanges between Lane and Algy, though. The muffin scene was nicely adapted, however.

<P>how _do_ you remember these things? i quite liked the coffee break song (in fact, recommended the musical to a coffee-loving friend on that basis) - but doubt i remembered the melody the next day. in fact, the only tune i retain from the show is 'brotherhood of man' - and i have to admit, that is largely due to the fact that it was ingrained in my memory in childhood as the theme for the hamm's beer commercial.

<P>Well, I have a fairly decent memory for certain musical numbers. Having the soundtrack on cassette tape helps, of course. I'm disappointed that I lost my &quot;Les Miserables&quot; tape, as I saw &quot;Les Miz&quot; last night and hoped to continue to immerse myself in the tunes for many nights to come. Interesting to learn that &quot;Brotherhood of Man&quot; was used for a beer ad. That and &quot;The Company Way&quot; are the numbers I was most apt to hum or sing to myself on long walks.

<strong>Re: No such thing as too Napoleon!</strong>
<P>&quot;brotherhood of man&quot; is a great number. i saw &quot;how to succeed&quot; in the theatre - must be 5 years ago, before it went to broadway - the lead singer on it was a woman, and she had this great gospel-style delivery - it was a real show-stopper. which makes it doubly irritating to keep expecting a tag-line of &quot;hamms, the beer refreshing....HAMMS!&quot; (in a pseudo amer-indian beat, yet).
