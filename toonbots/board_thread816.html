<strong>Nobody expects the Toonbots Jihad</strong>
<P>OK, this is shaping up into a kind of a theme. Not exactly a story line yet, but something like it. I have good ideas how I want to draw gopher and Emsworth in Toonbots form. Napoleon, I realized, I can't express yet, especially since she's transparent. I have a vague idea of Chris but haven't sketched anything yet.
<P>Pooga Poogissima, too. After all, Pooga has ASCII art of himself.
<P>(1) Does anybody have anything against my effectively usurping your online identities for Toonbots? I did this with BoxJam without even asking, but I'm being nice to the Jihad.
<P>(2) Does anybody else want to be in on it? This is all glych's fault, so I guess I should also include her. As a triangle with eyes, of course.
<P>(3) This isn't going to be real soon (because the Toon-o-Matic needs some work) but I'd like to make sure it leads up to the Anniversary of the Defenestration of Prague. In some way as yet unspecified.
<P>(4) Where is this darned draft coming from? I'm freezing. It's right on the back of my neck, too. (Maybe I'm being haunted.) -- Wow. My wife left a window open *upstairs* and I felt the draft down here. Methinks the house is more porous than heretofore thought.
<P>
Here's what I think gopher (the Jihad character) looks like:
<img src="http://www.vivtek.com/toonbots/gopher.gif">
<P>
And here's what Emsworth (the Jihad character) looks like:
<img src="http://www.vivtek.com/toonbots/emsworth.gif">
<P>
I can <i>almost</i> draw Emsworth with no additional features, but gopher will
take some work.  I just tried doing some sketches of Chris, but it just isn't
gelling yet.  Napoleon will have to wait, too.
<P>
As I said, anybody can opt out of this treatment if they're a wimp, and nobody
will think any worse of that weakling at all.  And as Emsworth said, at CRFH
and BoxJam's Doodle, people beg for cameos and here I am intending to make you
full-fledged characters.  You should be grateful!

<strong>A word on my motivations here</strong>
<P>Yeah, OK, I started this Toonbots thing, and I write the Toon-o-Matic, and I write all the episodes, and in some way this whole Toonbots thing is my sense of humor reified -- but at the same time, this teensy-weensy community is for me an inherent part of Toonbots. Toonbots without the Jihad is ... I don't know, it's Simon without Garfunkle, Pirates without Penzance, Peter without Pan, get what I'm saying?
<P>That's part of what makes Webtoons unique, and I've always wanted to incorporate some kind of feedback into the process. Back when I was thinking about randomly generating the episodes, I wanted to take phrases from the message board and use those as a base theme to compose variants on. Since that's well beyond the language capability of anything I can write this year, I've been wanting to do something by hand. And when everybody suddenly started being in their own comics, I thought, OK, how should I be different and weird?
<P>This is the result. Toonbots *has* a Jihad, and people should just get used to it.

<P>Or perhaps Toonbots is the Jihad and the Jihad is Toonbots? In a meta sort of way.
<P>I love the whole Jihad thing, though. As far as I know there isn't another webcomic where the fans and the actual comic-type thing are linked like this, and that means I got in on the ground floor of a New Thing, and that makes me feel special. *glee*

<P>&gt; Do I get one of those cool hat things? Seems like the whole point of
<BR>> joining the clergy is the nifty headgear.
<P>I rather like that idea. Too bad I can't draw it.
<P>Well, we'll see what the facilities of the Toon-o-Matic suggest once I can even get close to what I want.

<strong>Re: Chris's aspect at least somewhat fixed</strong>
<P>&gt; I'm not hearing any comments on my rather unusual use of hand drawing
<BR>> tools (OK, MS Paint). I don't do this for just anybody.
<P>I wondered why there wasn't any source code, or how you managed some of the curves. At first I thought perhaps the Toon-O-Matic had simply been making more strides than I'd thought. Still, nice work.

<P>The wicked live in constant fear of eternal defenestration. Though the fear doesn't make much sense in your case, regardless of wickedness levels, since auto-defenestration just doesn't seem quite as ominous, and it would be darned silly.
<P>I suppose this means that Michael's representation is a success?

<P>I have to admit it's got a lot going for it. It's friendly, yet incredibly disturbing on a visceral level. And hey, it's got a little hat!

<P>&gt; I wonder what Emsworth will think when he wakes up to a new 37 (and
<BR>> growing) post thread. hehehe.
<P>He'll think that, at least no one can blame him for this one.
<P>I'm also rather surprised and very gratified by this turn of events. I'm quite surprised by my representation. Does the name &quot;Emsworth&quot; suggest a monocle? That surprised me, especially as its oddly close. The fictional character Lord Emsworth, created by P. G. Wodehouse and from whom I borrowed the user name, generally wore pince-nez, but his brother always wore a monocle. Still, pince-nez might be slightly more difficult, and I think I prefer the monocled look myself.
<P>Agreed that the High Priest could probably use more details, but I like the teeth.
<P>I'm looking forward to the Anniversary of Prague with even greater anticipation now. You know, this is the best Jihad I've ever been in (only jihad I've ever been in.) Sniff. I love all of you people.
