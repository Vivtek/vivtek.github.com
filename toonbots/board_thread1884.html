<strong>Current Toonbots (8/16/01)</strong>
<P>Well... Nice to see a new Toonbots, of course. I see you're leaping on the &quot;poke fun of George Lucas' corny film title&quot; bandwagon already. Nice usage of space towards the end, and always nice to see more of the dot. The All Your Base references are very worn by this time, but seem suitable to Lenin. And that's it, I suppose. Not a bad Toon, really, and better than nothing, but, well, somehow I was rather underwhlemed by it. Somehow seemed even more like it was just tossed together than other Toons which probably *were* slapped together in a shorter period of time. Still, I apologize if I seem too negative, and this is just one individual's opinion. Perhaps it's simply a result of my nervous mental state caused by lack of Toonbots and other personal factorsd. We'll see what happens next, then.

<P>I know what Emsworth was doing, cause I hoped it myself...he was hoping that by mentioning the 16th in his post, he could entice you to do a comic on the 16th, too. Maybe a special Thursday/here's the wolverines/Emsworth comic.
<P>Though, I dunno, the appearance of the second comic is somewhat soothing to me. I think I could almost make it through Thursday without a comic.
<P>Yeah. He did it on purpose! Yeah!
<P>

<P>OK, fine. Just for that, I'm going daily again. You'll be laughing out the other side of your mouth then!

<P>Pardon, I suppose I was just musing on how many days had elapsed since the lastupdate. Not an unnatural mistake, really.

<P>Well, you're the one who keeps taunting us with false wolverine promises and acting all churlish and refusing to accept polite criticism and saying we all need electro-therapy, until we find ourselves in considerable distress! What comes of spending too much time hanging around BoxJam, I suppose. Jerk.
