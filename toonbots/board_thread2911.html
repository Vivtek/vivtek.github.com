<strong>Harry Potter - 9</strong>
<P>Good movie! Effects were good, story (natch) was good, casting and character development pretty good and in some cases downright excellent, and of course without a TV I'm immune to the overbearing commercialization I've heard complaints about.
<P>It was, of course, sold out in the evening due to presales -- but once again the combination of self-employment and home schooling allowed us to take in an early matinee on opening night. Hee.
<P>Highly recommended. Not even too much cheesiness, which is what I was worried about.

<strong>Re: Harry Potter - 9</strong>
<P>We went to see this. Not so much because we had any inclination to do so, but more because the people we had for dinner /really/ wanted to go and made that part of their attending stipulation.
<P>I haven't read the book. I thought it was rather entertaining from that perspective and quite possibly enjoyed it even more than your average screaming child as a result.
<P>As a side note, we had a 9 year old seated behind us at the 11 pm showing. *visibly restraining myself from a tangental commentary on parenting nowadays* It kicked the back of my chair continuously for 2.5 hours. Except during the scary part, where it said rather loudly, &quot;I'm just going to put my head down now. Just tap my head when it's better, okay? Tap my head!&quot;
<P>I got yer tap right here.
<P>I will say this, though. We thought it was interesting that Harry seems to succeed, not so much because he works hard or is particularly bright or bothered to learn some spells. He seems to succeed because he has good genetic material and a couple of friends who are willing to save his bacon over and over. But I understand that wasn't the intent of the book. Which I think interests me even more, that the movie tended to give that impression.

<P>Wow. Normally I notice this kind of thing immediately, but I didn't this time -- and you're completely right. I guess where magic (i.e. software) is concerned I *am* elitist.
<P>I think movies do this because it works for George Lucas. Nobody wants to spend a bazillion dollars on a movie that strays too far from formula, no matter how many kids have already read the book.

<strong>Re: Harry Potter - 9</strong>
<P>&gt; Neither have I. Probably will, though. I have the excuse of having an 8 year old. The books vary from very good to bland kiddie stuff, but I guess that's forgivable. I will warn you that if you read the whole set, you will get very tired of the constant backreferencing in the later books. I assume that they (whoever &quot;they&quot; are) wanted to make sure if you picked up book 5 you wouldn't get lost. You still would, but I digress.
<P>&gt; Ha. &quot;Nowadays.&quot; I know, us awful parents nowadays. We suck. ;p
<P>The books do tend to have Harry fall back on his friends. Hermoine is the brain who always has the book answer (read: Velma), Ron is the troublemaker (read: Shaggy) and Harry just sort of skates by. It's a fairly constant formula up through the latest book, although it's started to grow out of that a bit.
<P>Regardless, I give JK Rowling credit for producing a book that my 8 year old will actually READ versus playing Nintendo or watching Cartoon Network.

<P>&gt; I have the excuse of having an 8 year old.
<P>Is it just me, or did anyone else's brain implode at the thought of Tirdun having children? I mean, I just dealt with the concept of Michael and children and now I've got to synthesize this information?
<P>Don't you people know that you're not supposed to be grownups with lives?
<P>You're /supposed/ to be destitute college students living in your parent's basements, churning out comics for my entertainment in some kind of child labor camp parody.
<P>(I'm joking, here. Please don't flame me and serve roast Jenn for Thanksgiving. I'm way more appropriate for Easter.)
<P>I'm going to Niagara for Thanksgiving! Yay! Have a happy Thanksgiving, everyone who doesn't live in another country!

<P>27, married 5 years, 2 boys: 4 and 8. :p
<P>&gt; Don't you people know that you're not supposed to be grownups with lives?
<P>I'm not &quot;grown up&quot;. I read comics, collect comics, watch cartoons and play with toys. My wife will likely buy me video games and toys for Christmas. And uh.. the kids will get toys too. That I'll play with.

<P>see, _this_ is the real reason people have kids - so they can take them to movies and play with their toys.
<P>personally i have always wanted to be an aunt - so you can play with the kids and then give them back to their parents when they get all sticky and cranky. unfortunately my brother selfishly refuses to get married and have kids so i can play with them. guess i'll just have to wait for my second childhood.

<P>Reputed to be the better of the two in any event. Alfred Einstein... but never mind about Alfred Einstein (not to be confused with Albert, 'course.)
<P>So long as everyone seems to be trading ages and marital statuses (statii? Probably --not--.) 32, obviously single for obvious reasons. *g*

<P>I used to be an accountant, myself... interesting coincidence, that. But while that's not quite what I meant, it was a quite considerable solecism for me to write what I did, and I very likely should -not- explicate (is that the word?) and -will- not, either.

<P>Very, very glad to hear it, indeed. For myself I spent the time in NYC and on Long Island (and saw the movie Amelie to which I personally would give the rating &quot;8&quot; - has Mr. Roberts seen it?)

<P>eric - you should feel no embarassment about being an accountant (or even a musician). to quote _tom jones_: &quot;we are all of us as god made us, and many of us a great deal worse.&quot;

<P>It's very much a nice line, any event ;)
<P>(Though I'm certainly not embarrassed to be a musician, not even the particular sort-that-can't-play-an-instrument that I happen to be (but who studies, listens obsessively to, works obsessively with, is always on the lookout for the unusual and the new-to-him in and deepening his understanding of what he knew already (hence, listening to this or that piece daily or more for weeks...), whose email and post-sigs are generally lieder-poetry or otherwise somehow involved with music- and even now finally has a job (unpaid, atm) of a kind that involves, music- that, yes, that I am... and happy so to be... putting me very near the 'O' in OCD for all that my official diagnosis isn't obsessive-compulsive but rather Asperger's Syndrome, a form of Autism, by the by! *g* )
