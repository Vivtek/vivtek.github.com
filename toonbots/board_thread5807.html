<P>you just gotta figure out the system.
<P>....which, admittedly, can be harder than your thesis work.
<P>anything in particular?

<P>Many things, actually. They kept shifting what I was doing as a TA (hated my work teaching freshman comp, now grader to a professor who isn't very good at communication and apparently wanted me to grade unannounced test but his e-mail telling me so was lost so he's all huffy), having hard time with one of my courses (got so stressed and near breakdown that I turned in a paper a week late), phone broke down and bought a new one but it still keeps cutting off half the time, no transport makes grocery shopping hard especially as half my food spoiled while waiting for a new *working* fridge to be supplied by landlady, and now I'm typing from library since power is completely out in my apartment building.
<P>On plus side, dad visited for my 25th birthday, the wolverines like the park which is full of cute and edible squirrels, wrote liner notes (though have yet to be paid by the guy) for an upcoming wartime cartoons DVD, *and*, THE ANIMATED MOVIE GUIDE can now be purchased from Amazon or in person from Borders, Barnes and Noble, and most other dealers, for about 26 dollars. I wound up contributing a total of 58 entries to that edition.
<P>So ups and downs, but I could use a period where things just stay steady.
<P>

<P>There's a reason many schools are unionizing, you know...
<P>&gt; I turned

<P>Perfectly acceptable way to manage stress, if you don't make a habit of it.
<P>&gt; half my food spoiled
<P>Now that *really* sucks after shopping on foot. Whew.
<P>&gt; power is completely out in my apartment building.
<P>It just sounds like Puerto Rico. We've had two power outages over 20 hours in the two months since we've been back. And the sewer clogged up on the road outside and they have a temporary line with a huge internal-combustion pump running to pump it through the temporary line. Right outside our window. Well, fifty yards away, but still, that damn thing has been running for three weeks now, and when the wind is wrong it blows the exhaust right into our bedrooms.
<P>&gt; cute and edible squirrels
<P>Yum.
<P>&gt; I could use a period where things just stay steady.
<P>Man, do I hear that.

<strong>Re: but hang in there...</strong>
<P>well, it _is_ traditional to give first year grad students the worst assignments. get close to one of the profs you actually like who needs TAs (but you will probably need patience).
<P>i am stuck between pleased and disappointed that you are eating actual perishable food, rather than the traditional fare of ramen noodles and instant mac-and-cheese - but your course is, of course, the wiser for overall health. are you a bicycler at all? i take it there is no decent public transportation. and you know....squirrels are pretty productive. the park probably wouldn't miss one or two :)
<P>the power outage just plain sucks.
<P>i was going to assure you that things do eventually settle down...but now michael has chimed in to remind us of his pick-up-the-family-and-move-halfway-around-the-world*several*times saga...*sigh*.

<strong>Re: but hang in there...</strong>
<P>&gt; well, it _is_ traditional to give first year grad students the worst
<BR>> assignments. get close to one of the profs you actually like who needs TAs
<BR>> (but you will probably need patience).
<P>Actually a much longer story than you guys assume, but they started me off teaching freshman comp with hardly any training or support, which was stressful, but after a failed exercise leading to students openly challenging me (quote: &quot;We'd get more done if you'd stop asking us how we're doing&quot;), I mentioned situation to coordinator... who after sitting in on one class, decided to remove me entirely. Yay. Actually, it was a relief in a way, and I kept my stipend, but it was also admittedly a blow and not exactly an encouraging portent of how the department works (though in fact that was also part of it, as while my grad work is under the English department, the teaching assistantship was under the separate Writing Program, which is more creative writing based and so on). Re-assigned to a Shakespeare professor as a grader, but been having problems with his last minute demands or e-mails not coming in (and as said, phone is still giving me problems; I'll have to find time weekend after this to make *another* long trek to the mall to replace). Sort of working that one out, but still no idea what they want me to do for next semester, though hopefully they'll work that out for next week. And still trying to get ahold of hospital to pay a bill, which annoys me considerably as I owe them $169 dollars for basically spending five hours waiting to be seen and being told that nothing was wrong with me, because the paramedics who insisted I be brought in because of heart rate and stuff also conveniently forgot to hand in their notes specifying the allegedly high pressure and unhealthy rates and so on.
<P>&gt; i am stuck between pleased and disappointed that you are eating actual
<BR>> perishable food, rather than the traditional fare of ramen noodles and
<BR>> instant mac-and-cheese - but your course is, of course, the wiser for
<BR>> overall health.
<P>Make that &quot;trying to eat actual perishable food.&quot; It perished, remember. Definitely not overly reliant on mac and cheese and ramen (though I have a little of each), but have plenty of canned soups, veggies, chili and beans (Andale! Eppa!) for when I get homesick, but my raisins seem to have disappeared.
<P>Overall health has been mixed, though. Cold weather seems to be giving me slight arthritic joint pains (still not as bad as doctors had said way back, but not unmixedly pleasant), severe migraines, and I think I caught some sort of intestinal thing which kept me up late at night with, no way to put it delicately, well, a rather distressing situation involving discolored (black and tarry) bodily wastes, exacerbated by non-functioning toilet, another recurrant problem with this apartment. And stress over paper, which led to basically spending four days stuck in my apartment having a nervous breakdown, also led to binge eating on oreos, and a bit of substance abuse problem. I'd wake up at 11am, find half empty bottles on the table, crushed cans everywhere, feel the aftertaste, see another six pack gone... and realize that Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi has me in its fiendish grip again. Hopefully next semester will involve fewer shifts so I can either find more time for walks just for the sake of walking or to explore the area (and not to rush to class or buy Excedrin, which may have had a role in the black waste issue), when/if weather permits, which I miss so badly, or maybe take advantage of the campus gym. If I can get some shorts, it would be nice to go swimming again. Do the elbow some good as well, I imagine.
<P>&gt;are you a bicycler at all?
<P>Ah, another item I forgot to mention. Friend gave me a bike right before I left El Paso, which was a pleasant surprise... But just as I was re-learning how to bike, and had a nasty spill which suggested I needed to have the bikes check... it was stolen from the basement where I'd been storing it. I hadn't had a chance to buy a better lock, and they managed to undue the cord lock I had. Some of my neighbors were leaving the basement (which is laundry space) unlocked, or even going off, leaving the door wide open, and taking the lock with them.
<P>&gt;i take it there is no decent public transportation.
<P>There's buses, but drop offs are limited, and trips to the mall or supermarket are long and also unpleasant (why do they try to cram 250 people, including two folks in large mechanized wheelchair, into an 80 capacity bus?) and you know....squirrels are pretty productive.
<P>&gt; i was going to assure you that things do eventually settle down...but now
<BR>> michael has chimed in to remind us of his
<BR>> pick-up-the-family-and-move-halfway-around-the-world*several*times
<BR>> saga...*sigh*.
<P>Which means he gets to see gorgeous sunsets and exotic scenery. Although on my own side, I did get to go to Ottawa for the animation festival (and attended a signing of the book I contributed to, for which I still haven't been paid and maybe won't be but hey, minimal payment at best was promised to begin with, and it was fun and a big notch on my resume). So there have been some compensations, but in general it's been hectic and apart from phone calls to parents (and occasional internet contact), I feel so very alone when it really matters, though again I'm so thankful for my parents. And at least I have plenty of cranberry sauce for when I spend Thanksgiving in the apartment with the wolverines and my stuffed animals.

<strong>Re: but hang in there...</strong>
<P>oh dear - this does sound a bit worse than the ordinary 1st year.
<P>you just reminded me of a woman i knew in graduate school. the first semester, she came to a halloween party dressed in pajamas, with her arm in a cast - said she had fallen in the driveway, and broken her arm. she had had such a bad time of things, we actually _believed_ her - because it seemed to fit in with all the other stuff that had been happening to her. (she started out the year with the absolute worst case of poison ivy any of us had ever encountered, and it sort of went downhill from there.)
<P>but eventually things turned around for her, and i'm sure they will for you, too. definitely go to the gym whenever you can - it is quite surprising how a bit of exercise can perk you up. and for heavens sakes, man - don't hole up in your apartment for t-day, at least take a walk! (maybe you can get a pigeon to supplement the squirrels - more in keeping with the holiday, and all.)
<P>wish minolta would fix my camera already - i would send you pictures of my cats to cheer you up.
