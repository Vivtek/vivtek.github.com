<P>or you could start yelling &quot;LURK'S A BURKER&quot;, which is cool because it has all sorts of connections to things that you have to be cool to get.

<P>Well, M. Burke hasn't posted in awhile, but he certainly has posted in the past. Never received a title (though he did complain about the lack of one once, while failing to specify a title), but was on the roster for a good several months at the very least. Slightly doubtful that that particular Boxjam post is indicative of Burke's current presence as a lurker on this forum, so much as it indicates Burke's memory of the slogan (which is not so surprising, given its constant presence on the main page as well as the fact that Michael uses it in his signature on the Keen boards.)

<P>No, no, I mean that there are actually two problems associated with the hard-drive situation. One is that messages (or in the few instances I'v noticed, usually one isolated message) are posted but later disappear. The other problem, which in the last couple days existed for me while the two now absent messages were still present, is that whenever one attempts to post a reply, it fails to go through. Napoleon and I both had a similar difficulty back around July or August, and the last message I posted before that problem arose disappear when it was corrected.

<P>These are excellent points... If i may, let us draw the proportion you give:
<P>Constant blame of minute points : penguins :: television : honeymoon
<P>As this shows, the important part is the hunt for penguins. One may be sure of one's quest _even without_ any such trivialities as the dust of evidence. When, however, in one's intensity of purpose one catches the scent of a distant connection it is natural to clear the third nostril of stereosmia to joyously track, trace by trace, one's prey to its cryptic haunts. One is reminded of one's joy in the transliteration of nakht, on a previous long and distant search for the hidden truth of things.

<P>ask them what goes with dictionary - i'm going to go home and eat one, to see if that helps in my quest for alliterations. (do you know how long it took me to come up with a 3-word one? - and then _you_ come back with a 4-word one with an internal suballiterative scheme) *sigh*

<P>&gt; another clue for the penguin hunt. i suspect too much herring in the disk

<P>Ahem. To debunk any paranoid conspiracy theories, disk space had been a problem long before &quot;The Penguins&quot; arrived. Such problems as disappearing messages or inability to post anything can be attributed to that cause, and this will probably happen again. This often seems to happen whenever the forum fills past a certain capacity and threads aren't being reaped, but since I've gathered the old threads, while currently inaccessible as archived threads, are still saved somewhere, that may not make much difference. Regardless, flightless arctic fowl have nothing to do with it.
<P>Oh, and remembered my original response to mouse's elation at evil twin status, which I was unable to post at the time. How long have you harbored this desire to be an evil twin? A somewhat unorthodox career goal, and not an easy field to break into. The simple matter of genetics, and actually being born one of a set of twins, or else separated at birth by bohemian greengrocers or whatnot. Then there's the union requirements and all that red tape, of coutse.

<strong>why can't i think of a good alliteration when...</strong>
<P>i need one?
<P>&gt; Oh, and remembered my original response to mouse's elation at evil twin
<BR>> status, which I was unable to post at the time. How long have you harbored
<BR>> this desire to be an evil twin? A somewhat unorthodox career goal, and not
<BR>> an easy field to break into. The simple matter of genetics, and actually
<BR>> being born one of a set of twins, or else separated at birth by bohemian
<BR>> greengrocers or whatnot. Then there's the union requirements and all that
<BR>> red tape, of coutse.
<P>well, doctor, i think it goes back to my early childhood. you see, i am an older sibling, which forced on me the position of &quot;the responsible one&quot;. you know, the one who was supposed to _know_ better, to set a good example - in short, to be a goodie-two-shoes. i yearned for the freedom to be irresponsible, wild, free, impulsive - yes, even evil. and to have a _twin_ - a ready-made scapegoat! (as my younger sibling is of the opposite sex, it was difficult to persuade others that _he_ was actually the one they saw doing whatever) (plus he had those big innocent blue eyes). but with a twin - imagine the power! one can do anything, and yet have plausible deniability. (and while that thing about dressing alike could increase one's impulses toward evil, it does make it so much easier to get away with it) (as long as your mom doesn't put your name on the front of your shirt, or anything).
<P>but, as you say, it is a difficult field to get into - especially when you don't actually realize the benefit of having a twin until you are 4 or 5 yrs old - bit late to acquire one then. (i did make every effort to be seperated from my brother at his birth - but my parents said the hospital had a &quot;no returns&quot; policy)(they probably just lost the receipt).
<P>but this psychic twin thing - a whole new world of opportunity! no one can see me behind this keyboard - all i have to do is quote woodhouse and know arcane details about serial killers, and i will have you all fooled! (well, and use capitals).
<P>now i just have to figure out how that will help me gain control of the universe - or at least my finances.
<P>and now that i think about it, do i really _want_ to be in control of the universe? i mean, talk about red tape....and people always whining about how hard things are, and of course you could blast them into non-existance, but then it would probably turn out that was the like, the only competant plumber, and then where would you be?
<P>man, this evil stuff is harder than it looks....

<strong>Discourse on desirability of doubles...</strong>
<P>&gt; i need one?

<P>Was a younger sibling myself, with no one below me, though I can't say that I can ever recall thinking about making anyone a scapegoat or desirous of being evil. Betty and I wound up blaming things on each other now and then, no doubt, such is the nature of childhood, but I doubt whether either of us thought much about it or took active pleasure in it. And of course, what price the other twin choosing to expose you or behave in a similar manner, seeing that their reputation has already been sullied by you?
<P>&gt; but this psychic twin thing - a whole new world of opportunity! no one can
<BR>> see me behind this keyboard - all i have to do is quote woodhouse and know
<BR>> arcane details about serial killers, and i will have you all fooled!

<P>Ahem. Learning to spell the famed English humorist's name accurately (&quot;Wodehouse&quot;) would also prove helpful, as would the ability to identify what his initials &quot;P. G.&quot; stood for.

<P>see, that's because you're the _younger_ one - it's us older sibs who have this whole load of resentment, replacement anxiety, etc, to deal with, thus the evil desires and need of scapegoats.
<P>although in reality i probably wasn't organized enough to work all that out during the hard-core sibling rivalry years. sibling relations are quite odd - well, i guess any close relationship is - i think people are able to make you nuts in direct proportion to how close to you they are. and even when my brother made me craziest, i didn't have truly _evil_ intentions. (ok, i used to bite him - but that's not really evil) but you gotta admit - there is a certain freedom to being evil that sometimes is appealing. i amuse myself when driving by deciding what curse i would put on various idiot drivers i encounter, had i the power to cast spells - some of them would probably be classed as evil by an unbiased observer. i like to imagine the havoc my curses would cause - but if i could really do it?...probably not. (altho the twit in the explorer who almost ran me over would be a real close call).

<P>you know, i _knew_ that looked wrong...and: pelham grenville (sir, even). 'course, it's been a couple years since i read much wodehouse - would have to do some research.

<P>As far as I know, my sister Betty never had any deep-seated resentment *or* evil desires (well, apart from teasing me constantly and chasing me with a butter knife on a few occasions.)

<P>What ho! I am indeed impressed, madame! On the off chance you are interested in reading more Wodehouse, however, feel free to e-mail me. Local used bookstore currently has a number of Wodehouse volumes and a couple omnibuses. Alternatively, Project Gutenberg has a handful of complete Wodehouse texts which have fallen out of copyright available for download, including the first Blandings novel, and a long-time favorite of mine, &quot;Something Fresh&quot; (available from Gutenberg under its American title, &quot;Something New&quot;.) One conversation involving stomach lining never fails to amuse me, and I may post it here before long. Here's a link to the Gutenberg version of the book: http://digital.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=2042 Other online libraris and text resources also have it online, if you'd rather not download. Not the same thing as actually holding it in your hand, and you can't take the novel with you to the bathtub this way, but useful for works such as &quot;Love Among the Chickens,&quot; which is currently out of print in the US, as far as I know.

<P>there, there, otu - as long as you learn to drive _responsibly_, you have nothing to fear from me.

<P>thanks! i do like wodehouse - have a few volumes lying around the place, and if i ever get the bookshelves organized, i may actually be able to find them

<P>DOUBLE thanks! - i hadn't encountered project gutenberg before (just what i need - another reason to spend time on the computer) - but a source of out-of-print books is just too good to pass up. what was the title of the first blandings novel? - that is a series i don't think i have read (mostly know wooster&amp;jeeves, and some misc. short stories)

<P>wodehouse did have a talent for titles. i could always print a copy out, i suppose (i will go back and carefully reread the &quot;small print&quot; first) - but must confess that e-books will never really appeal to me like real ones do, until they can be read in all the places real books can be (like the bath, and the patio (if the sun ever comes out), and standing in line). still, there is always the library, and alibris.

<P>Harrumph. I will not have you impugning the character of my sister. I consider such actions inimical to good fellowship.

<P>&gt;what was the title of the
<BR>> first blandings novel? - that is a series i don't think i have read
<BR>> (mostly know wooster&amp;jeeves, and some misc. short stories)
<P>Honorable mouse like man who order napkins in French restaurant... misinterpret things. I meant to say that &quot;Something Fresh&quot; was the first Blandings novel *and* a personal favorite of mine. The first book introduced readers to stately Blandings Castle in Shropshire, and to Clarence, Ninth Earl of Emsworth; his son the Honorable Freddie Threepwood; and his secretary the Efficient Baxter. Lord Emsworth, incidentally, is mentioned in passing in the Jeeves story &quot;The Coming of Jeeves,&quot; and Sir Roderick Glossop figured in both the Jeeves and Blandings sagas at various times. The most famous Blandings residents, beyond Lord Emsworth, is probably his prized pig, the Empress of Blandings, though she first appears in a slightly later short story and doesn't enter the novels until the third book.
<P>&gt; wodehouse did have a talent for titles.
<P>That he did. Unfortunately, like other trans-Atlantic authors (Agatha Christie being the other chief example to come to mind at the moment), his works were often renamed for publication in the US, or when they were reprinted or whatnot. Thus Wodehouse's last Jeeves and Bertie Wooster book, originally titled &quot;Aunts Aren't Gentleman,&quot; was changed to the more prosaic &quot;The Catnappers,&quot; which admittedly reflects the crux of the plot (Bertie winds up stealing a cat), but doesn't have the same punch or charm. besides. Wodehouse seldom chose his titles to reflect his plots anyway. Usually the title might be mentioned in passing as an expression within the book, but rarely much more of a connection beyond that. I mean to say, he was trying to capture the spirit of the bally thing, what what?

<P>&gt; Harrumph. I will not have you impugning the character of my sister. I
<BR>> consider such actions inimical to good fellowship.
<P>i apologize for any insult to your sister - as an elder sister myself, i was perhaps too quick to assume her experience was similar to mine (which actually now makes my brother sound worse than he was - i could say 'character' rather than 'experience' but not sure that's quite right either - but you know, mostly i was just _teasing_)
<P>&gt; Honorable mouse like man who order napkins in French restaurant...
<P>hey, i _meant_ to do that - trying to keep my fiber intake up.
<P>&gt; The most famous Blandings residents,
<BR>> beyond Lord Emsworth, is probably his prized pig, the Empress of
<BR>> Blandings, though she first appears in a slightly later short story and
<BR>> doesn't enter the novels until the third book.
<P>now i have to run them all down - i can't resist the appeal of a prized pig.
<P>&gt; That he did. Unfortunately, like other trans-Atlantic authors (Agatha
<BR>> Christie being the other chief example to come to mind at the moment), his
<BR>> works were often renamed for publication in the US, or when they were

<P>given wodehouse's style, it does seem unfortunate to try to pin his writing down with a prosaic, plot-related title (since the plots themselves are often so incidental to the actual story - definitely a case where getting there is most of the fun)
