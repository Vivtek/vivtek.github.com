<BR>> Nine-year-olds are really loud.
<P>Um. In retrospect, turning off all the lights while my wife was swinging outside the window dressed as a ghost pirate after my daughter read her story of piracy on the high seas was a little .... intense for most of them. Honestly, they'd been screaming all evening. How was I to know they really meant it this time?
<P>

<P>this is the problem with girls of this age-class - they seem to do a _lot_ of screaming. i remember my neighbor's daughter (when she was 9) walking around the neighborhood screaming at every bug, spider, lizard, etc., they encountered. and they encountered a lot of them. one hates to suspect they were actually _looking_ for things to scream at....
<P>&quot;swinging outside the window&quot;? ..... what a very..._interesting_ home life you do lead....

<P>Rope swing. Maple. Quite Middle-America, I can assure you.
<P>Turning the lights off from the switchbox in the basement was what really did it for them. My wife had pulled a white sort of lace scarf thing over her face and put on a pirate hat and sword, and swung on the rope outside the window. My daughter said she was pretty weirded out too -- I laughed in her face and said she *planned* it, how could she be scared of her own mother with a piece of cloth on her face.
<P>Tensions were running high. And a couple of the girls came later, individually even, and said how much fun the scary part was. I'm pretty sure this was one thing they'll remember all their lives. That's kind of neat, realizing that you'd ended up doing something that sounds like Garrison Keillor wrote it. A good feeling indeed.

<strong>Re: Sleepover madness</strong>
<P>Wow. You're the /cool/ house to have a sleep over at. Remember, one of your friends used to have the cool parents?
<P>I'll bet you let them stay up and watch SNL or whatever kids stay up to watch nowadays.

<P>Yep, that appears to be us. Frightening.

<P>Well, since we don't have cable, and since Bloomington sits in a little valley and thus only IU's PBS station can get radio waves in here, it was down to just stuff on DVD. They watched Matilda. (Which I love.) We had some other stuff on tap, but they were too busy just talking, really. And talking. And talking. And talking.
