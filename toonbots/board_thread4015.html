<P>I'm deducting 0.00000002 from this for the cheesy title, and another 0.00000001 for some cheesy dialog (while attempting to remember that Lucas *likes* cheesy).
<P>People, this movie rocked.

<P>hey - it was originally sort of a parody/homage of adventure serials - so cheesy is sorta part of the definition. (admittedly, he's gotten a _long_ way away from that)
<P>&gt; People, this movie rocked.
<P>i might have known you'd be camped outside the theatre.
<P>ok, ok, it's on my list - but i'll wait a bit till the crowds thin out.

<P>Maybe over the weekend or next week I'll try to go see it and force myself to NOT walk out after 45 minutes this time...

<P>What, but you didn't mark it down any for the interminable love scenes between Darth Ani and Amidala? Gads, those were horrid.
<P>Of course, Yoda's lightsaber battle rocked my socks off. I want to see it again, just for that. Well, and for the Matrix preview. &quot;I know kung fu,&quot; in stereo!
<P>And did you notice that Obi-Wan defenestrated himself? Aww yeah.

<P>LALALALALLALA I'm unable to recall any portion of any movie which causes me to cringe. Especially the really cheesy parts of Star Wars. So those don't count in my review.
<P>&gt; Of course, Yoda's lightsaber battle rocked my socks off.
<P>&quot;I kicked Gandalf's ass and I can kick yours, Master Yoda!&quot;
<P>&quot;Hmm? Futile, resistance is. Assimilated, you too shall be. Yes.&quot;
<P>&gt; I want to see it
<BR>> again, just for that. Well, and for the Matrix preview. &quot;I know kung
<BR>> fu,&quot; in stereo!
<P>Yeah, that preview definitely rocked. 2003. Jeez.
<P>&gt; And did you notice that Obi-Wan defenestrated himself? Aww yeah.
<P>Oh yeah, I noticed. That entire scene really pleased me to no end, especially where Anakin jumps over the side of the car and Obi-Wan says, &quot;I really wish he'd stop doing that.&quot; And later reaches up in the air and catches Anakin's dropped light saber.

<P>This has to be the most uniformly positive opinion on AotC. Most people I've heard complaining about various things from unbelievable strategy/tactics on the part of the Jedi Knights to the unbelievability of the relationship between Anakin and Amidala.
<P>::shugs:: Like many, I'm waiting for crowds to die down. And if possible will go to a matinee showing. Near the beginning of the week.
<P>Assuming I feel well enough. (What else are meds for?)
<P>Peace, Tim Bram.

<BR>> I've heard complaining about various things from unbelievable
<BR>> strategy/tactics on the part of the Jedi Knights to the unbelievability of
<BR>> the relationship between Anakin and Amidala.
<P>Saw this last Sunday night with the aged parent (had hoped to attend a matinee showing, which sold out; wound up waiting 'til 7pm, as the pater had set his heart on seeing *something* in a theatre, and possible alternative &quot;Spider-Man&quot; had also sold out, and we'd already seen &quot;Ice Age.&quot;) First Star Wars movie I'd ever seen, and enjoyed it more than I expected to. The complaints about Anakin and Amidala are justified. Didn't think too much about the battle tactics, though. Tried not to analyze the film too closely at all, really. However, I did, to my surprise, find myself caught up in the excitement of the moment on several occasions. Yoda's scenes were particularly enjoyable. Frank Oz' voice work was fine, the CGI surprisingly expressive, and Yoda's big showcase scene (which I won't spoil) was both exciting and hilarious to watch at the same time. Really, Yoda and Christopher Lee were practically the only stand-out performers, though. Oh, and for the record, if anyone's seen &quot;The Lion King,&quot; one of the lead animators on &quot;Star Wars II&quot; also worked on the wildebeest stampede in tha film.
<P>Not sure if I'd have enjoyed this more if I were a Star Wars fan, or how much of my enjoyment arose from having low expectations, but it was a lot of fun, and a great way to while away an evening.
<P>&gt; ::shugs:: Like many, I'm waiting for crowds to die down. And if possible
<BR>> will go to a matinee showing. Near the beginning of the week.
<P>The crowds are probably the biggest drawback to this film. We had originally planned to see this a month from now, if then (had mostly just joked about it with Dad, surprised when he actually decided to go.)

<strong>say what???</strong>
<P>&gt; First Star Wars movie I'd ever seen
<P>really?? not even on tv? the original trilogy has been out in so many different formats (even re-released with additional cgi before ep1) - i guess i sorta figured everyone had been innoculated. you _have_ to see the original at some point - it really captured the saturday-matinee essence, yet retained its sense of humor about it. that was one thing that kinda struck me about episode 1 - they seemed to have gotten way too serious about things. of course, the original probably doesn't have the impact now that it did when it first came out - still, it's worth watching.
<P>i am also waiting for the crowds to thin out a bit - was going to try tuesday (next week), but it turns out i have a meeting (i like to try to hit the twilite shows, but it means sneaking out of work a bit early). i've actually heard several good reviews (most conclude that it _is_ better that episode 1). i will be very interested to see christopher lee's performance - it struck me as an odd bit of casting, but he generally surprises me by being better than i expect.
