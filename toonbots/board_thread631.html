<P>God bless my soul! That's.... disturbingly brilliant! Hick bobbing his head about is really something. The &quot;Galileo&quot; bit with Mao &quot;Hey Fred&quot; Tse-Tung is priceless. That last panel is great! I really enjoy these &quot;all-star&quot; Toons. I'm printing this one out!
<P>I just wish I could see the XML source code, but for some reason, my computer keeps giving me a 404 message. I'll try later.

<P>Fixed. For some reason that page didn't write correctly. A second try wrote it -- which worries me, as I don't know what happened. Durned software.

<P>It was probably the monkeys' fault. Nice to be able to see it now, though. I'd forgotten that the Bard was designated as &quot;Will.&quot; He startewd some grand literary traditions, though.... Like the tradition of the drunkard writer.

<BR>> number of later ones have?
<P>No. It sorts by date of *last* post, not first post.
<P>Of course, I might always decide to change it completely arbitrarily. I don't want a complacent Jihad. Bad for everybody.

<P>HOORAY!!!! Glad you liked it. I'd been mulling it over for a couple of days and realized it had been _four_ days, which wasn't my intention.

<P>Ah. I was just wanting to see if it would do anything to alleviate my unjustifiably-high post count, but the current run of thread deletions seems to be pulling this off quite nicely.

<P>I just noticed, as you scroll down it, the ruddy thing seems to resemble a scythe or unusually long talon, waiting to swipe at us all. Will the line stretch out 'til the crack of doom? (I also expect the eventual loss of that thread to cause quite a major decrease in our post counts.)

<P>Stop that!
<P>No, only threads which have been quiescent for a week or more (to the second) will ever be deleted. Unless, of course, I change my mind.
<P>But *that* thread is really starting to bother me. So I might make an exception just to be nasty.

<P>Between that thread and the &quot;Honor&quot; one, I can't even tell which threads are disappearing. When that one's gone, though, it will be a lot easier to scroll down and check other threads.

<P>And yes, it might be easier to check other threads once the huge ones are gone, but we don't come here for ease, do we? No! We come to worship the Bots of Toon! Or something. Don't ask me, I'm tired.

<P>(indulges in a quiet chuckle) Well, you've pulled out of it quite well, but don't blame me, blame the meta-cartoonist for archiving threads. At this rate, I wouldn't be too surprised to discover one day that we all have barely two to four posts at most.

<P>Nope, I'm firm on leaving things at 256. Can't get any rounder than that. And that'll leave a couple of weeks of postings, I figure, which is enough for a kind of Zeitgeist.
