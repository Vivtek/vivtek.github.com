<strong>Well.</strong>
<P>Actually, I'm not as depressed about the outcome of the election as I had expected. I stayed up way too late watching the trainwreck, then went to the beach the next day and backed the minivan into a tree, shattering the rear window -- but that was lack of sleep, not depression.
<P>No, I'm interested now, in the sense of watching good opera. Now Kerry can't be blamed for Iraq or the back-to-back recession I expect. (The dollar is already falling like a rock on the international markets, which is good for my income when seen in dollars.) Instead, the junta is going to get impeached, and Monkey Boy still gets a chance to fulfill the 20-year curse.
<P>Silver linings all around.
<P>I'm really wondering if the Democrats are ever going to play to win, or if they like being losers. They sure don't campaign like people who care.

<P>oooo - i'd forgotten about that! ....except then we get cheney. so - the answer is, to impeach him first. that shouldn't be hard - there seems to be all kinds of stuff coming out about halliburton.

<P>some of them do. the woman running for congress in my district really put in a lot of work, and energized a lot of people. unfortunately, she was running against a guy who has been in office for 18 years, in firm partnership with the military-industrial complex, which has been funding him handsomely.
<P>the problem is finding a consistent message when it comes to the national level. that, and the fact that republicans keep associating any tendency to talk rather than go straight to blowing things up with wimpyness - and we can't have any of _that_ on the national scene. unfortunately, the day of the 'sensitive male' seems to be done.... but there must be some way to sell the idea that the truly strong can afford to be patient and gentle.
<P>ah well. guess we have a few years to work that out. at least, i _hope_ we do.
<P>
