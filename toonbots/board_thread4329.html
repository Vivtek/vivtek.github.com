<P>Those have been there for a long time (even longer than it's been since you could see them...) -- they're a side effect of the Grim Thread Reaper. Eventually I'll fix it. In the meantime, shut up. (Napoleon, dear? Maybe it's time for a nice defenestration.)

<P>don't they? that does seem to leave a hole. as i remember, the 'sparkling' jellos were white grape .... but of course that's not quite the same thing.
<P>on the other hand, there is grape jelly, which does maintain better structural integrity at room temperature...

<P>I missed the first episode myself, but according to online sources, he is indeed a regular, as Shepherd Book, the &quot;space preacher.&quot; Since the last time I saw him in a regular role was on the horrid sitcom &quot;Teen Angel&quot; as a giant disembodied angelic head, I'll probably be watching this series.
