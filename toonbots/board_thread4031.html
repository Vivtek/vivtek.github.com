<strong>Christian Gangsta Rap</strong>
<P>I actually have some Christian Gangsta Rap. I looked for it one day just to see if it exists at all, and I found the Gospel Gangstaz. Such wonderful, inspiring lyrics, like &quot;see, prayer is how my text spit, my Bible's my next clip \\ i worship and praise the G, you step to me and you get checked quick&quot;. I take it that bot, too, is a fan?
<P>Oh, and happy defenestration day, everyone.

<BR>> to see if it exists at all, and I found the Gospel Gangstaz. Such

<P>Being a Christian myself, I have to say that this doesn't make anymore sense than a large fraction of other rap lyrics I've encountered.
<P>Or is that a careful conspiracy by the people pulling out excerpts? (And a whole new conspiracy theory is born.)
<P>Peace, Tim Bram.

<P>If you want the whole thing, their lyrics are reasonably easy to find. That particular excerpt was from &quot;Do or Die&quot;. Personally, I don't think that the rest makes any sense, either. I think it may have something to do with trying to combine the gangsta rap style with that whole &quot;love your neighbour&quot; thing, or maybe it's just mainstream(ish) rap in general. Whatever. I just think it's funny.

<P>i must admit that rap in general makes no sense to me, and i avoid it whenever possible. &quot;christian gangsta rap&quot; seems to be rather an oxymoron....one of those desperate attempts to look bad, while actually being good - which is, in fact, rather funny - it shows how much more charismatic bad guys are than good guys.
<P>the idea of _any_ rap music played by a jug band is downright hilarious.
