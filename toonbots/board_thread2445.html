<strong>9/22</strong>
<P>*g* thanks. Had some especially bad news (personal and not unexpected) today and a good chuckle like this is accordingly appreciated.
<P>-Eric Schissel notices the hour and decides to invent sleep.

<strong>Re: 9/22</strong>
<P>Dash it all, I hadn't checked the main page, and assumed Schissel was referring to the Sep. 21 strip (especially as I hadn't received an e-mail, ahem ahem.) Still, considering how often Toonbots has been updating lately, the mailing list hasn't been as necessary anyways.
<P>Interesting effort from Damonk (even without the Toon-O-Matic, though I hadn't fully realized that until I checked the source code, as per usual.) Still hoped Mao and Dick would meet, but as you said, the Chairman and friends are still at learge, so who knows?

<P>Truth to tell, I forgot the list. I was doing Damonk's episodes late at night and tired to start with -- and they took a *lot* of work! A *lot*! (I was surprised. As I said, I realized that my own storylines are greatly influenced by what the Toon-o-Matic can express....)

<P>I thought you'd catch the foreshadowing on Friday.

<strong>Oh, ye of smarmy humour</strong>
<P>&gt; I thought you'd catch the foreshadowing on Friday.
<P>Mao's intention of looking someone up, yes. But I was keeping in mind the possibility that you might be merely stringing me along with false expectations simply to feed your surly and callous sense of humour (though it wasn't a &quot;NEXT: NIXON&quot; panel, at least, though that will probably just give you ideas.) You've been gaining so much pleasure lately from playing with your fanbase's fragile emotions. What comes of spending too much time spontaneously combusting in front of yellow signs.
