<strong>Re: Wolvies!</strong>
<P>waitaminit. you mean these people have been calling themselves 'wolverines' all these years, AND THEY HAD NO WOLVERINES???
<P>no wonder modern sports are in such a state of disarray. i mean, you name teams after nonexistant animals, and what does that teach them about honesty and respect? hmfh.

<P>Ahem? Are you saying wolverines are non-existent, or thinking of things like the Kansas Jayhawks or whatnot? Did you miss the Discovery Channel special? (I need to find that tape.)
<P>(Awhile back, I had to dissuade someone else of the notion that wolverines were mythical.)

<P>perhaps by nonexistent the murid one has spoken briefly for non-there-existent? they have had no Dasein (or for certain no Daoffenbarkeit). though extant, their extance had gone elsewhither. these michiganders had flown the lake, one thought for good. whatever. welcome back!
<P>Gwendolyn, is this any relative you recognize, by chance?

<P>precisely! ...i think. (although i'm not sure about the barking)
<P>anyway, i meant that the michigan people were calling themselves after a creature not actually found in their state - it seems sort of like if california called itself &quot;the penguin state&quot;. i mean, yeah, they're cute....but still.
<P>although i must admit - i rather like one suggestion in the article, which was that the wolverines were there all along, just hiding out. i guess it's because it seems like such a rational thing for them to do....
