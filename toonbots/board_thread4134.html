<P>I don't know about the others, but I've only just now seen the new comic (was sick for a while).
<P>It fits quite nicely with the previous NAPOLEON/Yoda comic. Somehow, I think you may not be that far off the mark in the characterisation.
<P>So yes, I thought it was funny.
<P>Peace, Tim Bram.

<P>heaven forfend! no no - just busy - which usually doesn't stop me, but just got connected to a new server (which had me down for awhile), then of course all the wrinkles about talking to the new server have to be ironed out (which involves me being off) and now that we have the new server, i have room to put up all the data that i've been promising everyone i would put up as soon as we got a new server, which involves my assuming a second identity, which has no bookmarks.
<P>&gt; Have I finally managed to drive all you people away?
<P>actually really truly i think i was trying to formulate a response to your travel plans - which sound exciting but also a bit scary - will you be able to keep your business going over a mobile modem (or whatever you said)?

<P>Heck if I know. I'm not going far until that question's answered, of course. Well, except for the possibility of Australia. Or New Zealand. New Zealand's supposed to be really nice.

<P>it's really pretty, from what i can see, although apparently earthquake-prone. (some people find that disturbing) and they have cool animals.
