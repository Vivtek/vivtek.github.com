<strong>Toon today</strong>
<P>Today's toon (if it comes today at all) will be late. I'm debugging a new feature. You'll like it.
<p>Note: I only know you'll like it because Pooga told me you would.

<P>Hey! I'm supposed to be in charge of the self-fulfilling prophecy around here! Just because you're the Meta-cartoonist is no call to undermine my authority! You don't go around defenstrating people yourself, do you? What's the point of having a jihad full of lackeys if you go around doing all their work yourself? You should have delegated that prophecy through the proper channels to me, so you could get on with the Miracles of Toonbot whilst I predicted that we would like it. I feel so useless now.
<P>I want a cookie.

<strong>Re: Toon today</strong>
<P>And lo, the VOICE OF THE META-CARTOONIST came down from above, and thus it spake:
<P>&gt; You must have, um, missed the disclaimer. Yeah. Read the message more
<BR>> carefully, that's it.
<P>Then He took the world in His hands and reshaped it to His liking, and suddenly it came to be that His lowly prophet Pooga recalled having said such to Him, and was chagrined at his blasphemy of having called out to Him in anger.
<P>&quot;Oh strike me down,&quot; cried out Pooga, &quot;for I am unworthy of you, who in his power can alter the flow of space and time! Send four worthy minions to defenstrate me as is proper against one as vile as myself!&quot; And with that he prostrated himself at the feet of the Meta-cartoonist.

<P>Actually, that was supposed to be &quot;Send forth your worthy minions...,&quot; but not being able to alter space and time myself, I'll have to live with the consequences. Assuming I live through four defenstrations, that is.
<P>At least *I* won't have to live with the conseqences of defenstrating someone without securing Napoleon's permission first. :)

<P>And the High Chancellor did assure that Chris the Untitled, who was not the Duke of Anything, nor the Earl of Anyplace In Particular, and certainly not Lord of Any Realm In Existence, having jumped the gun, did in his jump follow a geometrically perfect parabolic path over the gun, through the window, and to the street some forty-two stories below.
<P>Then, there was cake.
