<strong>The attrition begins</strong>
<P>As threatened, I have now created a message board archiving system. This spins all the old threads off into a set of static pages, then it looks at the threads still online. If there are more than 256 messages online, then it finds the oldest thread, and if that thread hasn't been updated in a week, it deletes it.
<P>Then it runs a summary.
<P>Which means that gopher has already lost a post, Lee has lost four, and so on. In testing, I've deleted the three oldest threads.
<P>Nobody will actually be drummed out of the Jihad, because the summary script still knows your title -- but gopher, Napoleon is easily going to overtake you. I wonder if she wants to be High Priestess as well as Minister of Defenestration?
<P>MWUhahahahahahhahaaaaa!

<P>'Saright. I was just wondering, especially since each one of these new messages seems to kill a thread. I presume it will just continue like this until the total reaches 256? Or will the script devour all the posts, and eventually travel over the phone lines to erase the data on our hard drives and eventually eat our souls? ;)

<P>And a sizable nuclear stockpile, of course. It's no bloody use preparing for the apocalypse if there never IS one. :) Of course, that may be one of Michael's side projects:
<P>THE NUKE-O-MATIC!
<P>Capable of launching strategic or tactical nuclear strikes against up to two hundred pre-programmed or completely random targets!
<P>Now you, the humble computer user, can experience the thrill previously reserved only to commanders-in-chief, military despots, and the criminally insane!
<P>For added fun, play in the multiplayer mode, allowing up to eight different nuclear powers to strike simultaneously!
<P>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166, 24 MB RAM, Windows 95 or better, fallout shelter highly recommended.
<P>PRICE: Just $199.99 ($249.99 for Mac version) and your mortal soul!*
<P>From VIVTEK, which has not been acquired by DiabloCorp, no matter what you may have heard.
<P>* The heart of your firstborn male child may be accepted in lieu of a soul.

<P>Can we use someone else's soul, or are they non-transferrable? Since I'd sort of like to keep my own soul, and I'm not exactly going to have any firstborn's hearts available any time soon.

<strong>Soul consumption</strong>

<P>Well. Actually it's supposed to simply *package* your souls for, you know, consumption at a later date. What did you think the Toon-o-Matic runs on?
<P>No, each message doesn't eat a thread. I just ran the script a couple more times for the halibut -- plus it ran once at midnight, because midnight is of course the best time for death. From now on it will run once a day, at midnight. If there are less than 256 posts, it won't eat any. And if the latest post in a thread is newer than a week ago, it won't eat that thread.
<P>Simple.

<P>So technically we could thwart your script by making sure each thread, no matter how old and decrepit, has a shiny new post at the end, yes?

<P>Sorry to tell you this, Your Meta-Eminence, but...
<P>The PAFTWJ accounting office informs me that, due to the facts that you 1) are not a registered soul-eater, 2) have a gross adjusted soul income of between $40,000 and $44,999 a year, c) were once caught attempting to smuggle souls out of the country (remember O'Hare, '87?), and Arthur) have not paid the salaries of any Jihad member in three months, you owe taxes on that soul amounting to just slightly over 1420%.

<P>Interesting fact: Despite the recent archiving, this forum still has more posts than the vast majority of Keenspace boards, and with the lost threads, has nearly as many posts as a handful of Spot boards. I'm not sure whether we should be proud about this, distressed, confused, indifferent, or simply forget the whole thing and relieve any mental anxiety by seeking the ever tranquil influence of the dot.

<P>It's almost scary, given that only about ten people have ever posted here. I guess that's what it'll get you to be part of a Jihad instead of just a fan group like other strips have to get along with.

<P>Maybe I'll make an exception for BoxJam. He's just such a jerk.
