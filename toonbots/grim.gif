<strong>Interesting Wodehouse Quote</strong>
<P>I recently was rer-reading a Blandings novel, and came across a passage which, when taken out of context, seems appropriate for &quot;Toonbots&quot; (and has a phrase which might be suitable for &quot;Snail Dust&quot; as well):
<P>&quot;Turning as purple as the stripe on his pyjamas, he gulped twice, blew at his moustache, allowed his eyes to protrude in the manner popularized by snails and in a voice of thunder uttered a single word. 'Trout!'&quot;
<P>from &quot;A Pelican at Blandings&quot; (1969), by P. G. Wodehouse

<P>&gt; Life is good.
<P>I might point out that over on Napoleon's board, Chris was inspired by this Wodehousian prose to reach breath taking heights.
