<P>he's back! he's back! and with a new toon, even! (but i thought you _liked_ episode 2?) (although i will say - lucas should either hire only english actors, or let the american ones talk american)
<P>and when did you take up with baboons?

<P>Loved it. But the acting, as somebody put it, was as though no director had shown up and they decided to wing it anyway. Please. Al Gore could act better than that.
<P>&gt; and when did you take up with baboons?
<P>A few months back. Remember I said I might come to San Diego? That's not going to happen, but they still hired me for some Zope work, which has been a nice little job.

<P>well, i won't argue for any best actor nominations here (altho i was willing to give anakin a bit of a break - figured he was playing a 19-year-old who takes himself _way_ to seriously, and they do kinda act like that - i mean, he probably spent the last 10 years thinking up what he would say to padme if he saw her again - it's the only way to explain his dialogue)

<P>sorry about san diego - i knew there were some odd types over at the supercomputer center, but i didn't realize they actually had baboons. (no, i know, the baboons are actually somewhere else - but if you'd met some of those guys, you might wonder for a minute too.) still, glad you got some work out of it.

<P>Oh, sure, sure, 19-yr-olds *are* wooden with girls, that's not my problem. I really kind of wanted a little better dialog between the two Jedi to be perfectly honest. Eh. I'm not even really sure. The delivery was just too damn ... wooden, that's all.
<P>&gt; sorry about san diego
<P>I may still end up there for a bit. Who knows? Sounds like a nice place, Vernor Vinge lives there, and when my wife's dissertation is finished, there's no reason to stay in Bloomington, and one really good reason to leave soonish: if we rent the house out in August as opposed to October, we'll get a higher price. Over a year, a hundred bucks difference a month adds up to real money.
<P>Or maybe Florida. Or Brazil. Or Thailand.

<P>you'll need it, if you plan to live in san diego. it is a nice place, though.

<P>I must have got assimilated to it by the second half, it failed to irk me as much then. Too many clones, and tin-plated acting, competing with it I suppose. But it was hard to take up through landfall on Tatooine.
<P>But the wolverines... they redeem just about anything. Guess I'll go with 10-\epsilon, too.
