<strong>Jello, again!</strong>
<P>Temporary greetings to the Jihad.
<P>Good heavens, I don't post for a few days, and when I have a chance to catch up (stuck on campus for a couple hours), I find that the jihad has been overwhelmed by zombies, and I've been defenestrated twice!
<P>Ah, well. Hope the wolverines have been well treated (at least they seem to be well rested, or one of them is, at least.) Things are still a bit iffy (did lousy on a humanities paper; fortunately, my Spanish professor will defenestrate the lowest test score, so that's something), and the mater is still threatening to remove our internet connection at home, but I'm hoping to have things cleared up by spring break (I might be able to post sporadically until then, but we'll see.)
<P>Rather flattered to find my departure mentioned on the front page. And many thanks to the High Priest for taking over my duties as spoiler specialist. Now that glych has been taken into the fold, what will her title be? And I take it the esteemed High Chancellor is branching out to obfuscation now?
<P>I've paid rather scant attention to the Napster debacle (never used Napster myself), but the Napster kitty's switch from &quot;meow&quot; to &quot;Mao&quot; in the Feb. 14 strip was quite amusing. And yes, it is rather neat that characters can now turn their heads. Lenin's been getting a bit more panel time lately, I see, but I still think Chairman Mao is clearly the Groucho of this Marxist contingent (even if he does have a disturbingly piercing gaze.)
<P>Well, that's all for the moment.
<P>(And yes, the jihad is decidedly entertaining. Pity, in a way, so few seem to take advantage of it, but then again, I rather like this current elitist hierarchy.)
<P>

<P>&gt; Ouch.
<P>The pun is sharper than the sword, after all.

<strong>Re: Jello, again!</strong>
<P>Oh, I forgot to mention this earlier, but I checked the Keenvention. Loved the defenestration animation (perhaps a link could be placed on the PAFTWJ page? Seems appropriate.) Excellent work, congratulations to Michael and Napoleon (and like the High Chancellor, I also like thorough credits.) Also liked Butch's dialogue.

<P>Totally -- I hadn't realized it was already up.

<strong>Re: Jello, again</strong>
<P>&gt; *looks around*
<P>&gt; Darn. I wanted Jello.
<P>Apologies, obscure joke, as I'm a Jack Benny fan. During the years when his radio program was sponsored by Jell-O (1934-1942), he'd always introduce himself at the beginning with those lines, an easy way to get the sponsor's name in.
<P>Of course, he had to drop it when Lucky Strikes became the sponsor.
<P>

<P>See how bad off we are without you? We need you, man! But getting skullwork done is a Good Thing, and hence must be done.
