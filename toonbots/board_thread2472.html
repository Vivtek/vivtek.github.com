<strong>I'm back!</strong>
<P>Okay, so I'm back now...
<P>I have lots of forum to read and keep me occupied. But I wanted to say hi first and to comment that the tv seems to be very centered on how we're going to defiantly going to continue our lives as normal cause terrorism is geared to disrupt that.
<P>That's fine if you don't live in NYC.
<P>But we didn't have internet access at work for almost two weeks. How normal is that? (no tech support jokes, please.)
<P>And we didn't have computers at all for a week cause the network is down cause all of that is housed in Barclay St and no one can go in there because it's across the street from 7 World Trade Center.
<P>And the subways didn't run right for 4 days. If at all.
<P>And we had double the number of people in our office that we usually have, because BNY owns two very large buildings they couldn't get into down there.
<P>And one of our people, Irene, lives in Battery Park and wasn't able to go home until last Monday.
<P>And we didn't have cash machines or credit card machines all weekend because the phone lines weren't working right.
<P>And now, every morning, I look at my shoes and I think 'Will I be able to walk home in these?'
<P>Sure, I didn't lose anyone (my friend in the Pentagon turned out fine). But it /has/ made changes in my life, and my attitudes, and my thoughts. Things will never be 'the same' for me, at least.
<P>(and...because that was /way/ too serious, I lost the top dog position on the forum! WAAAAH!)

<strong>Re: I'm back!</strong>
<P>glad you're back -- and hope the disruption, at least, is settling down to something approximating normal levels of confusion. i have to admit, i'm one of the people ready for a return to normal life - but i live a long way away from you, and i don't think i've ever successfully visualized NYC as a real place. i can visualize you as a real person though, and i have thought about you every day. i am glad that you have lost no actual people, but i sympathize with you for the loss of so much of your city (and i know the loss is a lot more than just the physical stuff).
<P>of course, now i will actually have to fight for my position (don't tell anyone else i said this, but these other guys are posting wimps -- i mean, it took a whole infrastructure collapse to stop _you_ -- and _these_ guys are just whining about _work_) (at last! a worthy opponent)
<P>anyway, can't talk now - i need to run find my asbestos-lined anti-wolverine suit with the super-size headphones, for protection when brother emsworth reads that.
<P>good luck to you -

<P>Already have. Fortunately for you most of the wolverines are still loose. Beware when they return, though (and High Chancellor Napoleon may be itching for some defenestration practice when she eventually gets back.)

<P>YAY! A defenestration at long last! About time certain parties were reminded of one of the most ancient and hallowed of Jihad traditions!

<P>well, see, this sorta thing is why i was missing people. i would have done it myself, except for a) it would probably have been sacrilegious and presumptuous and stuff and 2) the screens were up.
<P>wish i'd remembered the wolverines were out though - think the added weight of the anti-wolverine suit worsened the impact.

<P>&gt; a) Yes it would have
<P>In fact the penalty for unauthorized defenestration (i.e. any in which Napoleon fails to participate) is that a window is thrown through you.

<P>Punishment for sacreligious defenestration like ending to honorable Damon Runyon story... amusingly ironic.
<P>Performing unauthorized defenestration like handing hatrack to moose... unnecessary.

<P>&gt; Okay, so I'm back now...
<P>Yay! We've missed you! (Well, the wolverines haven't, they've been off gallivanting around.)
<P>I'm all politicked out, though. (We did manage to get Congress to slow down for some debate on the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, though... Seems they have concerns that it might be, oh, ANTICONSITUTIONAL or something. But Ashcroft sure is hot for it.) (Maybe I'm NOT all politicked out...)
