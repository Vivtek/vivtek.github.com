<strong>Polymer City</strong>
<P>What is this, some kind of Toonbots *thing* building or something? First Jenn says that her &quot;friend&quot; actually *recommended* Toonbots as an initial foray into the Webtooning scene (I have no idea who this so-called friend is, but it was a cruel, cruel trick to play on poor Jenn, now wasn't it?) (Oh, and Jenn? Is this your arm that Gwendolyn left under my desk this morning?)
<P>And today I saw that the Polymer City Chronicles has linked to Toonbots (http://www.polymer-city.com/) -- did somebody here submit me, or did this guy just find me on his own? Weird. Weird, I tell you.
<P>And yet daily traffic on the front page holds steady at about 40 hits a day. I just don't get it. First, who are all these 40 people every day? Second, if they tell two friends, and *they* tell two friends, and so on, why are there still only 40 of them?
<P>Am I obsessing? I'm obsessing. I'm going to go back to getting Oracle to accept my callbacks and give me LOB data. I understand Oracle. Oracle loves me.

<P>Let me rephrase that -- Oracle feels nothing whatever except for an inhuman and implacable hatred for me that burns with the heat of a thousand suns.
<P>But I still made it work. Hee, hee.

<strong>Re: Polymer City</strong>
<P>This is probably a good place to mention this...I was gonna save it for later...but...
<P>I found the forum archives quite by accident today. (You can stop laughing at me any time. It's not my fault that I just can't manage computers at all. And that despite Michael patiently sending me email after email, trying to explain where it was...I simply didn't see the button. In fact, I didn't see the button this time. I just happened to click on it because our home computer is so slow that it takes 3 minutes for a Netscape window to load, and I clicked on it accidentally. Yeah, yeah, yeah, MS people. Explorer takes longer and has a 50% likelihood of making the screen turn all blue.)
<P>Y'all sound really smart. Especially, like about computers and programming and stuff. If I'd seen that before I started posting, I would never have screwed up the courage to post in the first place. Cajoling from Michael (mostly I think cause I wouldn't stop emailing him otherwise) aside, of course.
<P>Anyway, my point is that this is clearly the thinking programmer's comic. And as such, should there really be a concern about the number of people who hit the site a day? In my experience, playing to the largest number of viewers produces such works of art as: Monster Truck Rallies. Budweiser. And any number of painful reality tv shows.
<P>It's a shame he didn't come up with (as of yet, I'm only so far as January in the archives.../89/ messages in a thread? Man, you all are verbose!) that thingie that measured quality. That's probably a better way to judge the strip than numbers.
<P>I did learn something else from the forum archives. I'm rivalling Lord Emsworth in post length. Gotta learn to turn off stream of consciousness...
<P>Jenn
<P>Shutting up now. Before the wolverines tear my fingers off.
