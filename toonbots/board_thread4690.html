<strong>Comic-Con 2003</strong>
<P>Well, just received tentative confirmation from the Comic Arts Conference (held as part of the annual San Diego Comic-Con, usually in the upper level away from some of the other events) that a paper I submitted to the on &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Literature and Pop Culture in the Victorian Age&quot; should fit nicely into one of the panels they're preparing. In addition to the experience and assisting in my long-term aim to become established as an animation/comic/film critic/historian, this also means the McNair Scholars program will be paying for our gas and my entrance fee!
<P>So, mouse, let me know if and when you know whether you are inclined or able to attend Comic-Con this year, and any time before July 17, let me know which days you'll be there (probably attend all 4 days myself), so we can meet, maybe have a feast of reason and flow of soul, watch disturbing cartoons together, heckle the Keenspotters, pose suggestively by windows (pity Nappy will be in Bloomington by then, and Michael should be in Budapest!) or what have you. I may even bring danishes and cheddar cheese and Tootsie Roll pops again!

<strong>Re: Comic-Con 2003</strong>
<P>hey - congratulations on the paper! (and even more on getting your travel funded)
<P>i'm inclined to try to attend; able is always the question. although for some reason i thought it was in september (which is going to be impossible this year) - july should be doable. my tendency is to aim for friday (i hate weekend crowds). too bad more of the jihad can't come, but i will look forward to meeting you!

<P>Well, we'll see as it gets closer to the day, but hopefully we two shall meet at Philippi! The URL for the official Con website, by the way, is www.comic-con.org Are you a Neil Gaiman fan, by the way? (Can't recall, have a vague notion it *may* have been mentioned before.) He shall be one of the chief guests of honor this year.

<P>umm...actually, i'm not familiar with the name (my areas of ignorance are quite broad, i'm afraid) - what sorts of thing has he done?

<P>&gt; umm...actually, i'm not familiar with the name (my areas of ignorance are
<BR>> quite broad, i'm afraid) - what sorts of thing has he done?
<P>Wrote the currently successful novel American Gods, contributed radio scripts for Scifi.com's &quot;Seeing Ear Theater,&quot; co-wrote &quot;Good Omens&quot; with Terry Pratchett, wrote the English translation for the film &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; long-time writer for the apparently popular Vertigo comics &quot;Sandman&quot; and &quot;Death,&quot; and of all things, *very* early in his writing career, wrote a biography of Duran!
<P>Other guests/panelists currently include Will Eisner (creator of the classic newspaper comic &quot;The Spirit&quot;), Alex Ross (rendered the Oscar poster last year, I think, or was it the year before, and done some wonderful DC graphic novels in a very painterly style, notably &quot;Kingdome Come&quot;), Bob Bergen (current voice of Porky Pig for most Warner Bros. projects, heard in the Oscar winning &quot;Spirited Away&quot; as No-Face and done bit voices for &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame,&quot; &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; &quot;Lilo and Stitch,&quot; upcoming &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and more), Mark Evanier (writer and voice director for the &quot;Garfield&quot; cartoons, writer for Sergio Aragones' &quot;Groo&quot; series, and once sat next to Abe Vigoda during a screening of &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind,&quot; which apparently Fish hated, muttering &quot;Why the hell is he doing that?&quot; when Richard Dreyfuss messes with the mashed potatoes), Julian Bolle (current artist for &quot;Apartment 3-G&quot;), J. Michael Strackzynski (also done radio scripts for Scifi.com's Seeing Ear Theater, but better known as creator of TV's &quot;Babylon Five&quot;), longtime golden age DC editor Julius Schwartz (known for his affinity for weird covers, often featuring gorillas), and more to be announced (hopefully Ben Affleck and J. Lo will stay away this year!) Thus far, the Keenspot contingent is set to include the inimitable Brad J. Guigar (we can heckle him together and call him &quot;Gooeygar!&quot; and badger him about the long delayed second Greystone Inn book), Chris Crosby, Alan Foreman, and more to be announced. Probably J. T. Darlington again as well.

<strong>Re: Comic-Con 2003</strong>
<P>...i actually _read_ &quot;good omens&quot; not that long ago (and enjoyed it) - but clearly my mind is turning to fuzz. i really liked babylon 5 (and even crusader) - so at least there will be _two_ people i'm not entirely ignorant about.
<P>jeff d. was saying in his news update today that comic-con was looking a bit tentative now, since both he and his wife are looking for new jobs. i thought lee herold posted something about going, but not having a booth. and i assume pete abrams will be there - it will be interesting to at least observe the worshipping fans....
<P>

<P>Ooooh! Nappy will be so sad that she missed meeting Butch's lord and master. If only I had a hockey mask lying around somewhere for him to sign... (And I'd best make sure the pater isn't there when/if I meet him. Not sure he'd approve if he knew I'm amused by a comic about a lovable and neurotic serial killer.)

<P>well....the appeal _can_ be a little hard to explain....
<P>i checked his forum again - he said something about 'walking around one day or so' - so hopefully he will post more explicit details later.
