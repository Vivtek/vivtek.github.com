<strong>I think....</strong>
<P>That 27 posts in the last four days could be a record. Do you think it matters if 12 of them were mine? Actually, I CAN count, I do know that there were 31, but four of those were in a thread that wasnt started by me, so they dont technically count.

<P>well, it's been a little quiet here of late - some periods (now, alas, lost in the lost archives) have been a bit more exciting.

<P>&gt; well, it's been a little quiet here of late - some periods (now, alas,
<BR>> lost in the lost archives) have been a bit more exciting.
<P>Such as that one time in January of 2001 when Napoleon and I engaged in a lengthy string of conversation (sparked when gopher accused me of cannibalism) and wound up racking about 30-40 posts a piece, followed by a certain outcry from other forum members. Ah, the good old days.
<P>So 27 is assuredly not a record of any kind. It's merely the fact that more of us have been pre-occupied (including Michael), a few seem to have vanished all together (I miss Pooga, though I noticed he posted recently at BoxJam's), been donkey's years since we've had a decent defenestration (save the anniversary of the Defenestration of Prague), and of course the strip has reached a point where we're fortunate if it updates once or twice a month. And I've run out of &quot;fish in the face&quot; comic covers to share. So naturally the feast of reason and flow of soul would stagnate unless new stimulating channels of conversation can be found.
