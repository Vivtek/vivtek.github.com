<strong>Metacartoonist soon to be literal</strong>
<P>So yeah, *I* am still going to be Too Cool for Keen, but Lenin won't. I doubt Len's going to be too prolific, but it will amuse me to have a foothold at one remove in Keenspace.
<P>So: coming soon. http://lenin.keenspace.com. Ideas welcome. I have one already, a gag strip. I'm pretty sure clipart from it will wend its merry way back to Toonbots.

<P>&gt; So: coming soon. http://lenin.keenspace.com.
<P>ok, no fair posting links to non-existant sites - now i will have to remember it later to bookmark it.
<P>so....'literal'. does this mean actual drawing - or just all text?
<P>(btw - what _is_ the difference between keen _space_ and keen _spot_? i mean, i'm happy for boxjam and all (if he's happy)(does he do happy?) -- but does this mean he like actually gets paid or something? - i mean, all the boards and stuff look the same.)

<P>For the record, the differences between Keenspot and Keenspace include the fact that Keenspot was first, and the fact that almost anyone can put a strip up on the latter (when tech problems aren't overwhelming, anyway), while the spot strips are chosen. Does not mean that a given spot strip is inherently better than a given space strip. Still, there is a certain prestige factor involved, yes. Promotional advantages also exist, through more focused banner ads and newsboxes to promote a specific aspect of a strip. Keenspot has an e-mail subscription service for many of its strips as well (those whose authors agreed to it anyway), so hopefully the doodle will follow suit at some point. And though the success of banner ads and Keenspot Premium subscriptions have been debated, as far as I know, there usualy *is* a greater likelihood of receiving some sort of profit from one's strip on the spot than the space (again, as far as I've gathered.) Keenspot, though still known to have tech problems, is less likely to cause the major updating problems and other annoyances which seem to plague Keenspace cartoonists all too often.

<strong>Re: Metacartoonist soon to be literal</strong>
<P>Or, simply put. Keenspace is a club ANYONE can join where you don't get paid. Keenspot is invitation only... and you still probably won't get paid.
<P>HEY WHERES THIS DARN LENIN STRIP I KEEP HEARING ABOUT. I swear, word in keenspace is lenin, lenin, lenin. It's madness.

<P>does this mean that on a day like today, when half the keenspace 'toons i try to see give me 'connection refused' messages, it is in fact due to keenspace itself, so i should not be sending death threats to our sysadmin for all the new version software he put on that i figured was refusing to talk to anything else?
<P>this could be bad - i might even have to _apologize_.....and thinking up new death threats sorta gave some sparkle to the day.....
