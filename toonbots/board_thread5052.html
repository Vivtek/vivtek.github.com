<strong>Demise of old server</strong>
<P>Well, my hosting provider of eight years decided to get out of the business. Naturally, juggler of too many things that I am, I didn't have time to get everything moved smoothly; one of the very low-priority items was this bulletin board. Which, you will doubtlessly note, runs a HELL OF A LOT FASTER on this spiffy new server.
<P>Anyhoo, now that the holidays are over, and now that most of the other systems I had on the old server are running again (and all, of course, a HELL OF A LOT FASTER), I've taken pity and restored the bulletin board to its full functionality. Yes, yes, I'm sure the archives still don't work. And yes, I noticed that the *toon* archives aren't working either. Eventually the way will be made straight, and there will be rejoicing.
<P>Actually, I didn't take pity at all. I just got really tired of seeing those errors in the log as all you lovely people continued to check whether I'd gotten my act together yet.

<P>Errors? Log?
<P>Is that the deal where if I click on things like a hundred and two times during the day out of sheer boredom, you know about it? :)
<P>Clicky-clicky-clicky!

<P>It would. And sent us your mailing address. I have a vague notion I mentioned such at some point asking you to contact me with same. Quite possible that it was mere intention, lost in the flurry of activity; that it was overl;ooked amongst general forum scarcity and downtime; or the wolverines ate it. In any event, though I was unable to get Christmas cards off to anyone this year, the offer stands for all Jihad members and others, since I still have a box of no-message generic Woody Woodpecker, Curious George, and Bullwinkle cards to send out, especially now that it appears I'll have time for such things, apart from those earmarked for my 94 year old grandfather, who I really hope to visit quite soon.

<P>You know, I'm still stuck in the days when this board wouldn't let you post *unless* you included an e-mail address. Thus for awhile at the first, I assumed mouse was a hacker!

<P>You can ask all you want. The muse will move when the muse is damn well ready, apparently.

<P>The muse also forgets that it has guest codes which it could debug.
<P>The muse also has a tendency to produce catchy theme songs for 70's TV shows that never were, in my experience.
