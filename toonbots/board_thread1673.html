<strong>Wow.</strong>
<P>I gotta take vacations more often. I turned on the computer exactly once, more to prove to myself it was possible to program in the middle of the Atlantic than anything else. And I didn't do a damned thing with it, just made sure my weird Perl installation worked on the laptop. It didn't. So I fixed it. Then I turned it off and went to bed.
<P>It was great.
<P>And in the meantime, of course, Tirdun finished (we hope) his masterpiece. You do realize, Tirdun, that your fan story arc is (1) far, far longer than any story arc in Toonbots and (2) nearly half as long as Toonbots as a whole?
<P>My plan is nearly complete. Soon I will have all the power and glory of being the figurehead of a vast Webtooning empire, and I won't have to lift a finger. It'll all just run by itself.
<P>MWUhahahahhahaa!
<P>(Oh, and shame on the wolverines for demolishing my security system. We might want to watch Gwendolyn for a while, though. Those uranium mine tailings in the box in the closet might be a little tough on her gastrointestinal tract.)

<strong>Re: Wow.</strong>
<P>&gt; And in the meantime, of course, Tirdun finished (we hope) his masterpiece.
<P>Yes, I'm pretty sure that the whole Saga has purged my need to draw Toonbots fanart for a while. Regardless, that particular story is done. ;)
<P>&gt; You do realize, Tirdun, that your fan story arc is (1) far, far longer
<BR>> than any story arc in Toonbots and (2) nearly half as long as Toonbots as
<BR>> a whole?
<P>Yeah, but only 2 have XML written, and while I attempted to draw most so that they were at least possible within the Toonbots engine, I introduced characters that don't really exist (Castro and the Wolverines) and I'm fairly sure that Lenin falling from the window onto Bot is impossible.
<P>Either way, I hope it passed some people's time while the maestro was absent.
