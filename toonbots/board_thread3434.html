<strong>On film grading</strong>
<P>I *do* grade high, just because I like movies a lot. So for future reference, here's what different numbers mean:
<P>10 - surprised me with its quality; I don't think I could improve it. 9 - worth watching, even if there is the occasional mild flaw. Frankly, most movies fall into this category. 8 - something bothered me, either a specific problem or just the general feeling that the movie should have been better given the premise -- but I don't regret having seen it. 7 - the same as 8 except I wish I'd gone to the matinee. 6 - the same as 7 except I wish I'd waited for it to show at the mall for $1.50. 5 - distinctly bad. I don't regret seeing this if there was nothing better at the video store, and it wasn't a new arrival, and maybe it was just one of the 5 for $5.55 special or something. 4 - I was offended by this movie and what a waste of time it was 3 - Dom DeLuise was in this movie (nothing against Dom, I think he personally is pretty funny, but he really is a dead giveaway of a really, really bad movie.) 1 - Baby Geniuses.
<P>Just so we're all straight on this categorization scheme and all.

<strong>Re: On film grading</strong>
<P>&gt; so what does 2 mean?
<P>2 means no wolverines appeared (at least with speaking parts). General mayhem left behind due to their work out of sight -- doesn't count; this would happen regardless of film quality, and can't be helped.

<strong>Gradations of Film</strong>
<P>Thanks for clearing that up, Michael. I was getting a little concerned, cause I tend to assign a 9 only to movies that change my life, alter my perspective, make me feel deeply, and a 10 if they make my heart beat funny with the beauty of it all.
<P>Oh, and if there's wolverines. And I mean real wolverines, not just people who go to a school in Michigan.

<P>This one too gives thanks to honored metatoonist for clarification and light. I do hope though that (fellow? dare I hope so boldly?) jihadis do not take my interpolation as in any way canonical. Though arrogantly stated, the definition of 2 I gave is in no way covered _sub aegide Michael_.
<P>&gt; Oh, and if there's wolverines. And I mean real wolverines, not just people
<BR>> who go to a school in Michigan.
<P>Well, that's true. Without a wolverine's spoken part, a film otherwise worthy of a 10 could hardly rate higher than 2, maybe 2.5, simply on its intrinsic merits... That's a big gap. I had never noticed before what a tremendous difference it makes!

<P>i think by this time the mere fact that it appeared in the forum makes it canonical (and it _did_ involve wolverines). _i_ liked it.
<P>but jenn - be careful of those michiganders - they are not to be taken lightly.

<P>All ya gotta do is to wait for those three chords to come around, and claim a title.
