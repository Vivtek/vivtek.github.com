<strong>Leonids 2001!</strong>
<P>So I will be getting up very, very early tomorrow morning (or staying up really, really late tonight) because the 2001 Leonids over North America are hopefully going to be really impressive. New York time, check them between 4 and 6 AM Sunday morning. I will.

<P>Mmmmm. Supposedly the best in like decades. Hope they were everything you dreamed of. A few words about stargazing in NYC. Um. Lights.
<P>So we would have had to go out to like...Jersey at 4 am. Rather a daunting task when you don't own a car and the trains don't run but once an hour, if that. To top it off, it was cloudy. So we slept instead. Kind of a bummer, though.

<P>We had a light fog, which reflected Bloomington's light back. We saw a few really nice big ones, but out in the country (by reports) it was quite a show.
<P>It was still worth getting up for.

<P>I wouldn't want to go to Jersey at 4 am with a tank, much less a train. That place is scary. I did a week-long consultation gig at Bankers Trust, right across the river from Manhattan, and stayed at the Days' Inn at the airport. Demilitarized zone. Horrible place.

<strong>Re: Leonids 2001!</strong>
<P>i did think (for a minute or two) about driving out to the desert (too much overcast where i live) -- but after thinking carefully about spending all night driving around in the wilderness, i elected to stay home. still.....i do wish i'd seen it.
