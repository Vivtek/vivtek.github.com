<strong>Re: signs of life!</strong>
<P>&gt; wow - i'd forgotten about that. do you have my address?
<P>Yes, you sent it to me some time ago. However, various situations (the book assignment, family funeral, major housecleaning, flu) have led to the re-arrangement of my desk contents, and also caused a temporary loss of interest in sending anonymous blackmail notes, to say nothing of purely friendly greeting cards, ahem.
<P>Also been listening to old radio shows with a friend in Israel, on leave from the army, enjoying the fact that apparently all Elizabethan writers, when resurrected for the purposes of attending a literary forum arranged for radio, would rather argue and riot and then run off to the pub. Also listened to the one about the carrots and onions on Venus, and featured the following classic bit of dialogue: &quot;You can't do this. The United States Navy will not stand for it!&quot; &quot;Nor will CBS!&quot;
<P>&gt; is it really half-past march? where did the time go? where did the people

<P>No doubt Michael has been preoccupied and hasn't been able to arrange for him to run again.

<P>My dear mouse. May I remind you that I did not specify exactly whom the recipients of said blackmail notes would be. Merely mentioned that I've had no time for either.
<P>&gt; wait - david letterman was on this show?!
<P>Hardly, not in 1956. This was the CBS Radio Workshop, logs of which were posted long ago, and several shows uploaded for your amusement, but sadly ignored, and no preferences supplied for the home-mailing of a CD of selections from said series. Not even the talking tape recorders. Sob.

<strong>The Immortal Feh</strong>
<P>&gt; feh
<P>I confess to some curiosity about the increasingly common usage of the expletive &quot;feh,&quot; which is almost exclusive to the internet. Is this the result of the encroachment of Japanese animation and comics, or rather fan embracement of certain terms thereof or at least the perceived pronunciations, or a return to one of the most venerable Yiddish words, the ultimate insult and the strongest expression of disgust?

<P>&gt; the latter, i fancy... from the kosher nosh (http://www.koshernosh.com/dictiona.htm)
<P>Feh Not very nice/ Disapproving
<P>...which fits the way i had always thought of it (although actually i think i picked it up from 'nukees').
<P>it's not a word i actually say - in person, i would signal my opinion by tone of voice or expression - notoriously difficult to do in print.
<P>(although all this pertains to just 'feh'. the Immortal Feh was actually an itinerant arabian alchemist and rope-charmer, who was transformed into a djinn (and hence rendered immortal) as a result of an unfortunate incident involving saltpeter, a stolen opal, and a drunken mongoose. possibly this story is what brought 'feh' into use by the nuclear engineering community.)

<P>every word is exactly as i remembered it. i am beset, though, with a doubt as to {beauregard} or {the sultan}. my source, Ten Everlovin' Blue-eyed Years with Pogo (may its content survive unto the nineth generation), remains at my parents' home in New Jersey where i studied it over countless afternoons both rainy and sunny. i cannot claim true fanaticism, though; my brother (pbuh) was even more taken with it than i.

<P>Have you ever while pond'ring the ways of the morn, Thought to save just a bit, just a drop in the horn... To pour in the ev'ning or late afternoon, Or during the night when we're shining the moon?

<P>yes - you must. it's really wonderful, as kelly talks a lot about various things that were going in when he wrote various strips: reactions to his anti-mccarthy stuff, etc - and well as a fair amount of just funny things that happened in his life (he must have been a great guy to hang out with). it is, perhaps, a little disappointing, strip-wise, because it doesn't have (for the most part) the whole of a story line - just selected strips from the sequence - so one misses some of the detail (it does have a really funny sequence of sunday strips, though, all revolving around a door.)
<P>&gt; I did recently acquire a copy of the wonderful CD re-issue of &quot;Songs
<BR>> of the Pogo.&quot;
<P>amazon sent me a thing about that - is it really good? i love kelly's 'pomes' - but i was worried that the actually voices or accompaniments might put me off (i actually saw an animated show based on 'pogo' (many many moons ago) - and the main thing i remember is disappointment at how little the voices resembled what i _thought_ they should sound like) - still, i have less a firm vision of how the poems would go to music...ah well, so much for keeping the credit card bill under control this month....

<P>Well, you need have no concern about the voices, or rather little anyway. None of the songs are sung by specific characters, although a few seem tailored for characters, like &quot;Man's Best Friend.&quot; Kelly himself sings three, including the jaunty &quot;Go Go Pogo,&quot; a sort of Pogo election song, and composed the music for that song and four others. The CD also includes as bonus tracks two slightly strange Pogo children's records narrated by Kelly in an interesting, thick character voice, &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Can't,&quot; some scratch or audition tracks of Kelly singing, and Kelly's recorderd &quot;Word Fore&quot; for one of his books, from 1952 (not sure which one).
<P>Definitely worth acquiring, even if you just read the lyrics. Also, which Pogo show are you thinking of? The cel animated one (which included a few of the Songs of the Pogo tunes, this time assigned to characters), or the later stop motion one? Neither was perfect, and June Foray was actually lambasted by comics historian Maggie Thompson in a Funnyworld review for her performance as Pogo (leading to a heated response from Junie in the next issue or so). The stop motion one, produced after Kelly's passing, was an interesting experiment but doesn't quite work, as it is filled with dated late 70's/early 80's songs and chorus pieces, the characters in three dimensions seem slightly off, and the voices were mostly supplied by New York actors, with nary an attempt at Southern accents (Jimmy Breslin in particular was badly miscast as P. T. Bridgeport, though Vincent Price turned in a fairly fun performance as Deacon Mushrat).

<P>must have been the cel animation - it was a _long_ time ago. oddly, i don't remember the art at all - just my disappointment....
