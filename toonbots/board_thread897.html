<strong>One Fine Day in the Toonbots Jihad...</strong>
<P>http://rickbob.xidus.net/onefineday.gif
<P>This is a silly thing I doodled in my notebook today when I really should have been taking notes. (Michael, it's a BIG image [roughly 1100x500, 388k or so] so it's probably best to not embed it in the message.)
<P>Apologies to anyone whose identity was misrepresented and/or distorted. I was going from memory on the ones I did know, and wildly guessing on the ones I didn't. Not that it matters since I can't draw anyhow.
<P>I also apologize to anyone who was left out: Lectures are only so long and I don't have infinite ideas.
<P>And also to anyone who's offended by this -- it's just meant as a silly thing and you should take it as such.
<P>I think that covers everyone...

<P>I thought the wolverine was rather cute, myself gopher's dialogue seemed quite appropriate, though perhaps a bit too merciful, I enjoyed BoxJam's and Lee's argument, and I liked the fact that Napoleon seems to bring along her own windows, for use in open areas.

<P>Wow. I didn't anyone think anyone would actually like it. Thanks, everyone.

<P>&gt; &quot;w00t?&quot;
<P>Yes, &quot;w00t&quot;. I occasionally use it in real life, as well, usually with the same confused looks (at least I assume you look confused) from those close enough to hear. I suppose that it originally came from the much frowned-upon lamer-speak, but I still like it.
<P>The interjection, when used in this form indicates excitement and joy, but it can also be used to indicate a calmer acknowlegement of something that is rather nifty.
