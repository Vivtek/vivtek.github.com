<P>Eh, it's the same background noise we always have around here. Usually I manage to suppress explicit knowledge of it, but sometimes it kind of breaks through how insane our lifestyle is. The weird thing is, it helps to have someplace to write this down where I know that a few people will read it. Strange.
<P>Thanks for the well-wishes. Now I have a whole lot of translation to get through today, so I'll leave you all to discuss among yourselves.

<P>Matter of fact, just the other day Chris was talking about how you rarely mention your kids. Hope the home-schooling is going well. Several of my mother's siblings have home-schooled or are home-schooling their offspting (and my sophomore year of high school was spent at home.)
<P>As for Toonbots, I confess to being mildly surprised in view of the talk of a new storyline which accompanied the last Toonbots (then again, the &quot;NEXT: MORE MUSKETEERS&quot; caption should have been sufficient warning that there probably wouldn't be more Musketeers.) Still, today's was very amusing, especially the disclaimer with the orange-colored text. I've always had a fondness for storylines and coherency myself, but with Toonbots, of course, random absurdoty had been the norm for so long, after all, so it's probably just as well. Keep up the fine work and all that.

<P>My wife doesn't like me to talk about the kids online. Just in case.

<P>Ha. Well, the storyline won't really go *away*, it'll just ... be confused. When you least expect the Three Musketeers, in other words, expect them.
<P>By the way, this post brings the number of online board postings to 400, an all-time high. Cool. Maybe I'll have to kick the Cursed Thread Reaper into high gear or something.

<P>Understandable, really.

<P>Yay multithreaded plots (plotz?) !

<P>I seem to recall the number reaching 402 or so sometime yesterday afternoon, but I'm not entirely sure... still, the point is sound. This place is getting busy. :)
