<strong>I need more sleep</strong>
<P>I get negative when I'm tired.
<P>Say, where IS everybody? I've averaged 27 hits a day to the home page this week. Half what I had last week. Of course, Jenn's on vacation, and Eric seems to have gone missing as well. But I'd like to believe that my hits aren't just two people....
<P>Sigh.

<strong>Re: I need more sleep</strong>

<P>ok - guess you posted this while i was composing my rant (but see, i'm all better now - i'm back in lower case). i meant what i said tho.
<P>&gt; Say, where IS everybody? I've averaged 27 hits a day to the home page this

<P>um....i really didn't want to say anything.....but since i've started posting i have sorta gotten into checking in on the forum throughout the day... and i try to just keep that page open but sometimes things happen and sometimes i have to go back and check the main page and, well, you seemed so _happy_ with the numbers i really didn't want to disappoint you.....(and i _did_ tell my brother about toonbots, but he works in the computer field and just had a close call with layoffs so if he starts today he may get _totally_ depressed)
<P>did i tell you about my alternate personalities? they count as individual hits, don't they?
<P>

<strong>Re: I need more sleep</strong>
<P>i just went back and reread your rant (so that's 2 hits for me today).
<P>a) forgot it was a rant and not a blurb so my brother may not see it and get all suicidal. (the blurb is the same megolamaniacal pseudointellectual aggrandizement that so endeared this spot to me in the first place, and for which i recommended it to my brother)
<P>b) my rant is off on a tangent from yours (i was more on political power, you were more worried about the advent of the uber-business) but i still think they are connected. grass-roots action and activism - it's what got this country started in the first place. (besides, have you been watching the stockmarket? big business may be taking a hit after all. remember, when the meteors/comets/whatever hit, it was all the big dinos that died - the little ones hung in there and evolved.)

<P>Ha. I knew this, really. Eric really was the largest part of my hit growth. He's easy to recognize, being on a Mac.
<P>Just joshing ya.

<P>Humble apologies, but with school and family and morbid creeping fears about one's mental condition and whatnot, I'm fortunate if I can obsessively check the main page even once or twice a day (plus, lately I've had some serious difficulties getting the page to load at times.) At least one Jihad member has been even more pre-occupied and thus fallen behind.
<P>&gt;Of course, Jenn's on vacation, and Eric
<BR>> seems to have gone missing as well. But I'd like to believe that my hits
<BR>> aren't just two people....
<P>Eric Schissel recently attended a wedding and has been visiting family elsewhere in New York, but should be back on his old machine by Monday.
