<strong>What about that convention?</strong>
<P>Hey! Where's my synopsis of the convention I couldn't afford to go to?
<P>How can I live vicariously, if you two don't cooperate with me, Emmy and Mousey?!?!
<P>Get cracking now! This is more important than school or work or whatever other silly little things you're doing!

<P>This must be the time-traveler's convention, right? (Technically, you'd only ever need one.)

<P>Michael is right. Convention starts on Thursday (preview night on Wednesday), so we haven't even gone yet.
<P>Debating whether to try to take photos of the Klingon Lifestyle panel, or Hugh Jackman, and edit it so that the wolverines appear to be mauling them. (Jackman might be more appropriate, but I love the idea of the wolvies startling the Klingons. Bespectacled Klingon: &quot;Now, the Klingon Mating ritual is best performed in the traditional manner, but if hot coals and phasers aren't available, punch bowls and nylons will do.
<P>Young Klingon: That's write, Dave/Cth'Thnang. And if you really want to make a Romulan mad, grunt at *his* wife while putting your elbows on his fiber glass table and... Hey, who brough the large Tribbles to thisAUGHAMYFACERUNFORYOURLIVESJAHAAOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWAUGGGGH!)

<P>Well, it is last weekend in the future. Or several weekends from now in the past. Or made out of candy in Wonkaland. I think that the time travellers convention is a great idea. Who's up for starting one?

<P>You mean, starting &quot;it&quot;.
<P>I don't think time travel is possible, because I told my wife today, &quot;If you invent time travel in the future, you can come through that door right now and hand yourself your finished dissertation.&quot; And she didn't. Darn. It worked for Bill and Ted (one of the most inspired lines ever in a movie. I loved that flick.)

<P>Not necessarily. Just as there is more than one comic convention, there could be competing time traveller conventions, and we could all stand around and talk about how that other time travller convention sucks.

<P>I think that the best possible ending for the Matrix trilogy would be for Keanu Reeves to wake up in bed as Ted, sit up, and say, &quot;Whoa...&quot;

<P>ummm... i think you meant &quot;willob haben versuckted coulda&quot;, for the future-future alternative prespeculative tense - unless you meant to use the f-f speculative, in case you would add 'willa' - but i have to check the book...

<P>Actually, I was using temporal grammar as according to Red Dwarf, not Douglas Adams. I didn't feel like messing with weird fake German.

<P>actually, i was just making it up (although admittedly influenced by adams) (but my memory isn't good enough to remember exactly what he said).
<P>see, this is _another_ advantage to time travel - more and better linguistic confusion!

<P>I'm fairly sure the overlap between Classical and Quantum Aspect-Oriented Temporal Mechanics (CQAOTM) and Inside Tips in Multi-Level Marketing -- Getting Out Before the Crash (MakeMoneyFast!!!1) would be essentially negligible.

<P>i'm in! i think the whole area of time travel research is sadly neglected in this country. when i think of all the useful things i could do with it...well, it brings me almost to tears.
<P>and alternate realities - we need to work on travel to those, too. i mean _good_ alternate realities - not just the one the boss lives in.
