<strong>Comic-Con Update</strong>
<P>Well, my paper, &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Victorian Culture,&quot; is currently scheduled as part of a &quot;Comics and Cultural Interpretation&quot; panel, on Saturday, July 19.
<P>Mouse, confirmed your presence yet? Hotels will be fully booked soon if they aren't already, so it would be wise to check now if you haven't already. Also, let me know what days you'll be there, and if you have any familiarity with the classic musical adaptation of &quot;Les Miserables.&quot; A friend of mine and I are considering performing an amateur non-promptu selection of highlights from the musical at some point during the con, and need someone to play the female roles (Cosette, Mme. Thenardier, etc.) I'll provide copies of the libretto if needed, and don't worry about being conspicuous. The innumerable Klingons, Jedi, plant women, and so forth will provide sufficient cover. Also, let me know what your favorite cheese is.
<P>

<P>well, i was thinking of friday, but now clearly i will have to come saturday (congratulations!) i live in the area, so don't need to worry about hotels - just getting my act together. my familiarity with 'les miz' is, unfortunately, nonexistant - i suppose i could acquire a cd. i should perhaps confess that my proportions are more consistant with, say, a wagnerian 'brunhilda' than a 'cosette'. still - perhaps i could sing from behind the scenery. oooo - and a favorite cheese? just _one_? i'm pretty easy to please, but in general, i will confess a prediliction for the stronger flavors - sharp cheddar, non-mild feta (in fact, just had some nice tasmanian goat feta for lunch) - and string cheese is always appreciated for its entertainment value.
<P>plant women?
