<P>ok, emsworth - i have figured out the trolley schedule, so the only remaining question is, when is your paper scheduled? - i really would like to hear it. and we need to arrange to meet. i'm trying to decide what to wear - perhaps my trout shirt, in honor of toonbots (such as it is)?

<BR>> remaining question is, when is your paper scheduled? - i really would like

<P>Well, it's *sometime* on Saturday. (I'm still trying to polish it up this weekend! Having pussed up leg sores hasn't helped.) How many days will you be there? Also on Saturday (I just hope it doesn't conflict) is the Cartoon Voice Actors session (guests currently tentatively slated to include Gregg Berger [Odie and Orson Pig in the Garfield cartoons and various Transformers], Maurice LaMarche [The Brain, Toucan Sam], Greg Berg [Baby Fozzie on Muppet Babies], Jess Harnell [Wakko on Animaniacs], Mark Hamill [Joker in the Batman and Justice League series], Billy West [Stimpy of Ren and Stimpy, Fry and at least three other regulars on Futurama], Bob Bergen [current voice of Porky Pig, various Disney bits]), Gary Owens [Roger Ramjet, Space Ghost, numerous commercial announcers], and more.) Are you going for only one day, mouse?
<P>I'll be the bespectacled chap with prominent ears and a cane. You can refresh your memory with the 2001 con photos: http://www.vivtek.com/toonbots/board_thread2154.html
<P>So far, I think Guigar, and a few other Keen cartoonists maybe, will be the only folk we'll know. Napoleon abandoned us for Indiana so she could stalk Michael more easily. Unfortunately for her that he relocated to Hungary at that time.

<strong>Re: comic-con approacheth!</strong>
<P>right now i'm only planning on saturday - got a major report due at work, so i can't really take any time off, and i need at least some time on sunday to keep my life functioning. i wish they would post the schedule on their website - maybe they have, but i haven't found it. well, i'll just try to get there early, and see where we go from there. sores cum puss do not sound good - how's the healing going otherwise? i hope quickly, so you can enjoy the trip!

<P>heh - serves her right. shoulda stayed in california for the summer, and she could still have his place staked out by the time he gets back.

<P>As mentioned in the response to Jenn's return thread, healing better. Plan to put the ace bandage back on either tonight or tomorrow, designed to reduce the swelling, and hopefully leg will fit comfortably into pants again by next week.
<P>And oh, could you send me an e-mail with your given name? I have no way of contacting you beyond the forum, and would be nice to a) be able to address you as something other than &quot;mouse,&quot; and b) so I can look out for your nametag (though writing our nicks in marker on the tags wouldn't hurt either, but not always practical.)
<P>Yours, Andrew &quot;The Gimp&quot; Leal
<P>
