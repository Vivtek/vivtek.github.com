when muse strikes
works
machine
really give diddly damn
can use
interested
all
penniless web artist anyway
figure
out yourself
man
enough
page
sooooo liberating
feel better already
even post code
when
get around
minute sooner

toon-o-matic
single module complete
could use some more features
can
lay out
draw panels
uses image magick 5
2
3
called
perl
now
will see
follow
link
perl module
im stuff
ca get
work
windows
recall
objective
good software
baroque software
code calls image magick
command-line utilities
get things done
neat
almost certainly difficult
set up
know
even
going
document how
did
ha
love
page

already
geometrical shapes
cut/paste images
stand-ins

just know
having fun
far
links
panel-drawing module code
perl

well-explained
image magick
free
open-source
functional
image magick
decent place
look
want
write image manipulation software
library
lot
unix
easy
