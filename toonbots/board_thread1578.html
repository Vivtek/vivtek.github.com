<strong>Apologies</strong>
<P>Well, Tuesday was Zoo Day (and so I drove past Strange Dave's place of work) (no, not the zoo), and afterwards we had, in order, an electrical storm, a power outage, discovery of a fried modem, and a second power outage.
<P>Might as well be in California.
<P>At any rate, today included a rather long meeting with Douglas Hofstadter (my doctoral advisor now), followed by swapping modems with another machine and reading a *lot* of email, followed by some actual work, followed by babysitting my son while my wife and daughter went to their astronomy class (yes, my six-year-old is now sitting in on university classes. She's really cool.) And then I came home, wrote more email, did a tiny bit of work, and it's past midnight.
<P>So... no new Toonbots yet. Go look at Tim's VRML again. Heck, Tirdun'll probably do new Toonbots before I get to it. I'll whack something out tomorrow. It might make sense, it might not. It's Toonbots.

<P>What? Who!? Toonbots? You know, I've got my -own- crap to throw together, er.. carefully draw. ;) If I feel better anytime soon maybe I'll do another fan TB.

<P>Still no way to submit XML to your Toon-o-matic so we can debug our own episodes?
<P>Peace, Tim Bram &lt;-- really curious to see if he could produce something coherent, but unwilling to subject others to the horror until he's practiced.

<P>The major stumbling block is getting ImageMagick and the Toon-o-Matic working on my Solaris box. Then I'll give Jihad members password access. I don't want to open it up to the public until I have controls in place to avoid too much Slashdotting. Those controls will involve membership signup, usage metering, and queuing of rendering. I want to get it thought through before I even start -- and of late I haven't even had time to think, much less implement.
<P>Busy is good, though, when you're a sole proprietor.

<P>Yes. That definitely seems to be the case. A friend of mine has his own tech business and always seems to be busy enough for three or four ordinary people.
<P>Good luck with your projects, especially the ones that help pay for Toonbots. ::grin::
<P>Peace, Tim Bram.
