<strong>It was the gremlins, I swear.</strong>
<P>I posted! Well, I wrote something that took a long time and then when I went back later, it was gone, vanished into the cosmos. I thought I posted it. Then I thought maybe Michael made it so that it would /look/ like I had posted, when actually all my posts were going to the great beyond, since I had the audacity to suggest splinter groups, holy wars, and general Jihad mayhem.
<P>But then I posted it again (down there) and it did post, so I had to absolve Michael of all potential blame and apologize for even thinking he could be so underhanded. Publically. Which was quite humiliating, let me tell you! It wasn't until they started throwing the eggs and tomatoes that I realized that this might well be the end of the line.
<P>And they weren't even devilled eggs.

<strong>Yay! He can type!</strong>
<P>Look, everyone! Emsy's recovered enough that he can type again! Hooray!
<P>Did I inadvertantly describe the plot to a comic from the 40's that I've never seen again? It troubles me that I continue to do this. Perhaps I should start wearing a tin foil hat to sleep so that the penguins can't control my thoughts anymore. Or my grammar.

<strong>Re: Yay! He can type!</strong>
<P>&gt; Look, everyone! Emsy's recovered enough that he can type again! Hooray!
<P>Indeed! Probably should have mentioned it earlier, but about a week ago, they removed the dressing from my arm and gave me a removeable splint instead. Apart from being necessary for physical therapy, this also allows me to type with both hands again (as the left is now completely free once again), and doesn't weigh me down as much as the heavy dressings had done, thus making it easier to sleep at nights and allowing for greater freedom of movement and greater ease when transferring from wheelchair to bed or car seat and vice versa and so forth. And thanks for the congratulations.

<strong>to arms!</strong>
<P>it _has_ been quiet around here....._too_ quiet... (cue dramatic music)
<P>personally, i think it's the penguins.
<P>THAT'S IT! - michael has been kidnapped by penguins, which is why you haven't been awarded your title yet - penguins don't do titles, they rejoice in their uniformed uniformitivity. they are holding michael hostage as part of their nefarious plot to TAKE OVER ALL THE COMICS, thus indoctrinating innocent americans to wear formal clothing and eat raw fish (with heads). probably that whole 'lenin' comic thing is a front (i mean, a _literal_ meta'toonist - we should have known better) - the penguins _made_ the metacartoonist type that, and _they_ will be scripting the toon, and laughing as we dance to their polka of doom! they're already gaining control! you doubt me? - just type in http://lenin.keenspace.com/ and see where you get. that's right - the heart of KEENSPOT itself (they are boring from within).
<P>ARISE, JIHAD! we must put aside petty factional disputes, and free our beloved leader from the webbed feet of the Spheniscid horde! from the tickling of their scalelike feathers, and the constant diet of anchovies! spinclad, corral those atoms! emsworth, marshal the wolverines! tirdun, work on that death-ray thing! jenn, bring the jello! FORWARD!
<P>well, actually, maybe not _forward_, precisely...may have to reconnoiter.....where did that hole thing go?

<strong>Re: to arms!</strong>
<P>WE HAVE NOT KIDNAPPED MICHAEL. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD. THERE IS NO UNIFIEED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT. THOSE PENGUINS OVER THERE ARE NOT FORCEFEEDING PEOPLE RAW FISH. MMMM RAW FISH IS GOOD. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME RAW FISH? OF COURSE YOU WOULD. TAKE THE RAW FISH NOW. EAT IT. EAT IT OR MICHAEL GETS IT. PAY NO ATTENTION TO THOSE PENGUINS CARRYING THE PLATE GLASS WINDOW ACROSS THE STREET. THEY ARE INNOCENT WORKERS DOING THEIR JOB. YOUR ANTI-PENGUIN HYSTERIA IS NOT FOUNDED IN FACT. THERE IS NO UNIFIED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT. YOU SHOULD NOT FEAR THE UNIFORMITY. IT IS GOOD. CONSIDER THE PEACE OF MIND AND SIMPLICITY OF SPIRIT OF WEARING FORMAL ATTIRE ALL THE TIME. YOU SHOULD GO CHANGE YOUR CLOTHING RIGHT NOW. WEAR BLACK. YOU MUST NOT FEAR US YET. IT IS NOT YET TIME. THERE IS NO UNIFIED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT. MICHAEL IS JUST FINE. LENIN DOT KEENSPACE DOT COM IS NOT A FRONT FOR THE UNIFIED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT BECAUSE THERE IS NO UNIFIED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT. THERE IS ALSO NO PENGUIN REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLES ARMY. NOR IS THERE A PENGUIN FISH CATCHING UNION THAT WE ARE ALL REQUIRED TO BELONG TO AND PAY DUES TO BUT SOMEHOW WE NEVER SEE THE BENEFITS OF THE DUES NOR HAVE WE SEEN ANY OF THE MANAGEMENT PENGUINS LATELY BUT ONE DAY YOU WILL ALSO NOT BELONG TO THE PENGUIN FISH CATCHING UNION AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND. MICHAEL HAS NOT BEEN KIDNAPPED BY PENGUINS. THERE ARE NO PENGUINS. WE ARE NOT PENGUINS. WE ARE PUFFINS AND PEOPLE DRESSED AS LINUX MASCOTS. WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT MEMBERS OF THE UNIFIED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT. THERE IS NO UNIFIED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT. YOU SHOULD NOT BE COWERING IN ABJECT FEAR AS WE HAVE NOT YET LAUNCED OUR FIRST MAJOR OFFENSIVE BECAUSE THE PROPAGANDA MATERIAL CAME BACK FROM THE PRINTERS WITH ALL SORTS OF WIERD GREEN INK ON IT AND WE DIDN'T EVEN USE GREEN IN THE PAMPHLETS OR THE GLOSSY HANDBILLS. HOW MUCH GREEN DO YOU NEED FOR PENGUINS AND SNOW, NONE, THATS HOW MUCH. PLUS YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO PRING GLOSSY HANDBILLS, OR HOW FRUSTRATING IT IS TO HAVE SOMEONE LOOK AT IT FOR A SECOND AND THEN THROW IT IN THE TRASH WITHOUT EVER READING ABOUT HOW HAVING PENGUIN MASTERS WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE YOUR LOVE LIVES. THOSE THINGS COST LIKE A NICKLE A PIECE WHICH REALLY ADDS UP. REMEMBER, HOWEVER, THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU'VE HEARD THERE IS NO UNIFIED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT AND WE ARE NOT TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD. MICHAEL IS NOT OUR PRISONER.

<P>actually i have noticed several spelling/typos....i feel certain that a careful analysis of this will reveal the identity of the penguins among us (clearly we have been infiltrated). i was going to write a clever program to search all past postings for the pattern of typos and inconsistent usage of 'to' as both adverb and preposition, together with occurrance of uncharacteristic (but character-driven) words, but i was foiled by the destruction of the archives (and little details like occasionally having to work at my job).

<P>&gt; Well, I was going to answer the penguins and their strangely flattering
<BR>> post about something that I'm having difficulty remembering now.
<P>YOU SHOULD GO BACK AND READ THE PREVIOUS PENGUIN POSTS. PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE VOWELS AND THE SPACINGS BETWEEN THE WORDS THAT START WITH &quot;T&quot;. THERE IS NOTHING TO NOTICE. THE FEELING OF PEACE SHOULD GROW STRONGER. THERE IS NO UNIFIED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT. YOU WOULD LIKE SOME JELLO NOW.
<P>&gt; But suddenly I feel all warm and friendly towards them. Almost as though
<BR>> they might have been right all along. I Enjoy Formal Attire. And Fish
<BR>> Products Are Really QUite TAsty WHen ACCompanied BY RITZ CRACkers.
<P>THEY ARE QUITE TASTY. SOON THE CRACKERS WILL BE SUPERFLUOUS. FISH IS GOOD FOR YOU. ENJOY THE FISH. ENJOY THE FROZEN ICE. FORMAL ATTIRE IS FLATTERING AND MAKES YOU LOOK TALLER AND REGAL. PENGUINS ARE SUPERIOR BEINGS.
<P>&gt; WAIT. I FEEL A LITTle QUEASy. AND MY HEAD ACHES A LITTLe.
<P>IT WILL SOON PASS. SOME FISH WOULD MAKE THAT FEEL BETTER. TAKE THE FISH AND EAT THE FISH AND ENJOY THE FISH. CLEAR YOUR MIND AND THINK OF WHITE ICE AND WHITE SKIES AND IGNORE THOSE PENGUINS WHO ARE MOVING YOUR FURNITURE.
<P>&gt; IS THAT A HERRINg? WHY IS ALEX TREBEK WEARINg a PENGUIn SUIT?
<P>YES. THERE IS NO UNIFIED PENGUIN ARMED FRONT. YOU ANSWERED IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION WHICH IS NO LONGER A REQUIREMENT.

<P>One observes SUBJIGATION as well. Perhaps they wish to bring an unconscious impulse to dance sub jugum? Could we develop the impulse through carefully timed puns until they fall over helplessly?

<P>I'm actually a penguin, you see. It wasn't so much that I was bent on world domination as it just kind of got out of hand. It started with an interest in controlling herring futures and ice stock, and then it just kind of snowballed into this huge /thing/. And the other penguins, they counted on me. They wouldn't let up with their 'Jenn, you can't stop manipulating the world markets from behind the scene now, what will our children do?' and their 'Jenn, if you don't keep lime jello under control through clever use of the Toonbots forum, who will do it?'
<P>I'm sorry, Jihad. At first I considered you innocent pawns, but I've grown to like you and the dead communists. And your tenacity, when I kept taking down Michael's comics and storing them in the freezer where he'd never find them, forcing month long hiatuses (that trip to Hungary? He was actually in Duluth, trying to find his way out of a hedge maze.), or spiriting the archives away to NeverNever Land...it's heartwarming, really.

<P>or maybe it was really spinclad, who then cleverly covered his tracks with that false trail to snail dust....then again, i have always been suspicious of michael - he's kept strangely quiet through all this - and he never responded directly to THE PENGUINS, which would have been suspicious because of the time signatures...
<P>no, no, the mystery is unsolved - but i will never stop! i will unmask the true PENGUINS! you cannot fool me with the false confessions of your minion JENN! (or even by mispelling Alex Trebek). you just wait....._you'll_ see.....

<P>with the aid of an extra bucketful or two of dry sherry, the need to make sense of much of anything much less the hidden movements and motives of our spheenish friends (WERE THOSE MEN IN TUXES ON THE GRASSY KNOLL LAST NIGHT) abates greatly, the memory of a distant sigh seven dreams removed, indiscerned in the entails of a passing cloud. the student of mind receives the polar opposite of awakening, though both correlate with the ambient alogia. freed of pursuit, hypothetical FLIPPERED FRONTS could indeed make merry with every 277th post, had they not been CRUSHED!

<BR>> to toss random little bits of HTML into its displays?
<P>now that you mention it.....no. no, i haven't. is it supposed to be doing this? does it happen randomly with any display, or does it pick some displays randomly and insert html? is it displaying any other irregular or halucinatory behavior? blurred vision? an unusual fondness for fish and/or lime jello? any aches or pains? stiffness in the joints or muscles? sleep irregularities? we may need to do some tests.....

<P>&gt; (Wait. She might have said Crikey. Or is that British? I'm sure Emsy will
<BR>> clear me up in just a moment.)
<P>Well, as &quot;The Penuins&quot; pointed out, Velma seldom utilized any expletive other than &quot;Jinkies.&quot; &quot;Crikey&quot; is predominantly a British Cockney or Australian expression.
<P>&gt; (So who said 'Cripes', other than my grandmother?)
<P>No literary, film, television, or comic personage that comes immediately to my mind, I'm afraid. Not an uncommon expression, though (and a bit more international than &quot;Crikey,&quot; though I somehow associate it with either dirty faced paper boys or minor gangsters with poor complexions.)

<P>that's kinda sad....we lose the saga of napolean and everything (especially sad since we also seem to have lost napolean - not to mention gopher and pooga and other who live now only in our memories....).
<P>maybe you could publish it in book form. (and we could hide it in caves in the sahara, where THE PENGUINS can't get it) (or in shamu's pen, which is closer)

<P>In the meantime, for the record, most of the old Toonbots threads, including the Saga of Napoleon, can be accessed by a simple google search, either using Toonbots and a key word or phrase, or simply by using &quot;Toonbots message board&quot; and sifting through the caches of the results.

<P>Pardon and apologies, but I said use the Google *caches*. You can click on the link directly and get nothing, but choose the &quot;cached&quot; option beneath the link and text, and there should be no problem. If absolutely necessary, I can try retyping some of the more significant threads, but I'd rather you try the cached pages once more, please.

<P>And for the record, as mentioned elsewhere in this meandering thread, I am typing with both hands again, but still not overly anxious to re-type any lengthy text that can be accessed another way.
