<strong>Red Planet</strong>
<P>I can't decide whether this was a good movie or not. On the one hand, *somebody* was taking pains to get some stuff right: the fire on the orbiter looked like a zero-gee fire, she put out the fire by venting atmosphere (maybe the first nominally SF movie I've seen in which the script writer seems to have known that space is a vacuum), the robot looked good, the display technology is plausible.
<P>And then there were all the really, really stupid crap. A solar flare lasting roughly 70 seconds. Gamma radiation mysteriously blowing out lightbulbs. The habitat wheels stopping when the power went out, and nothing sliding along the floor (my theory: the director thought spaceships really *do* have artificial gravity, like the Klingon ship in the Star Trek movie where the gravity goes off, then somebody said, they do that with a spinning wheel in reality, but the guy didn't bother to look at, say, a merry-go-round.) And when the power came back *on* everything fell straight down. Instantaneously.
<P>Mysterious nematodes which burrow into human flesh, emit oxygen, glow, and burn explosively. Yeah, *that* makes sense. Actually, though, I managed to suspend disbelief on that one.
<P>And then there was the usual complete disregard for anything resembling an understanding of orbital mechanics. Sheesh.
<P>But the subtle mistake I noticed at the end: she gives him heart massage. In zero gee. There's no *way*, literally, she could get leverage.
<P>My wife thought that including a military mode on a robot for a space exploration mission was a pretty stupid mistake, and one they'd be unlikely to make in real life. I have to agree. And the robot going into a guerilla warfare strategy, when it was clearly superior and could just have killed the lot of 'em on the spot, was a blatantly stupid way to prolong the plot long enough to *have* a plot.
<P>But the kicker, the really completely implausible part -- they've sent a manned mission to Mars to see where the oxygen is disappearing to, but nobody thought to do spectral analysis of the Martian atmosphere first. Yeesh, even Hubble can do that, and twenty years from now I certainly hope it'll be easier yet.
<P>On the other hand, having a radio telescope on Earth pick up the ground crew's unexpected signal -- yeah! That was a technical solution I hadn't anticipated. So it's weird. Somebody involved with this movie had a clue, but not quite enough influence to make the clue spread over the whole movie, if you see what I mean.
<P>Does anybody else care about pseudoscience passed off as science in Hollywood films? After all, they pay consultants big bucks to make the military sequences as real as possible and they can't get some grad student for the price of a good meal to do the same for the science? Just doesn't make any sense to me.

<P>To an extent, and depending on the film: yes. Specifically, the OTHER Mars movie made that year had me rolling my eyes so often that I became dizzy. The main reason it bothered me wasn't so much BECAUSE of the techinical and physical improbabilities (if not impossibilities), but because through much of the film it's trying to play itself up as an &quot;Apollo 13&quot; of the future. They,re trying to make this seem like science fact that just hasn't happened yet. Of course they through all that away with the &quot;Face on Mars was created by aliens&quot; ending.
<P>A tip to future filmmakers (hundred of whom I'm sure read the Toonbots forum daily): if you're going to use a &quot;mysterious unexplained phenomenon&quot; as a major part of your story, make sure that it isn't one that was disproven over FOUR YEARS EARLIER! For those who might have missed it, newer photos taken in 1996 (IIRC) of the &quot;Mars face&quot; at a much higher resolution show that the geographical feature in question really doesn't look like a face at all. It was an over-enlarged section of a relatively low-res grainy picture. Finding the &quot;Mars face&quot; was the astronomical equivalent of finding a cloud in the shape of a bunny. This &quot;face&quot; is one of the key parts of what can only loosely be defined as the plot of this movie. Bah.
<P>I've thankfully blotted out most of the specifics, but there are many procedural items and occurences that left me scratching my head as to how NASA let themselves be associated with this picture. On request, I WILL submit myself to it again (my dad got the DVD as a gift) to provide details, but suffice it to say that you can take a great director, a great cast, and great special effects and still produce a movie that fails to do just about everything a movie should or could do. It's got the excitement and plotting of a documentary with the attention to detail and realism of a buddy-cop film.
<P>OTOH, there are many other films that have at least as big a problem with real-world physics that I quite thoroughly enjoyed. Armageddon was one. MI2 was another. The trick is knowing where to set your reality meter before starting the film.

<strong>Wiki Wacky!</strong>
<P>&gt; Well, OK, except for Napoleon, but everybody else is too afraid of her to
<BR>> say anything.
<P>As far as I can tell, a &quot;wiki&quot; is a term for online collaborative endeavours, usually with a focus on software and shared ware, but sometimes devoted to a particular theme or subject, with different individuals contributing. Leastwise, that's how I understand it, so there's probably more to it than that (apparently a lot of links and whatnot involved as well.) If there were a Toonbots &quot;wiki,&quot; at least a few Jihad members would probably read it. I'm sure I'd enjoy reading such a thing (then again, I also get a kick out of reading the pseudo-intellectual blurbs and the source codes.) Not sure why they use the term &quot;wiki,&quot; aside from the fact that it sounds Hawaiian and is fun to say. Wiki wiki wiki! I also now have Spike Jones' Hawaiian War Chant running through my head. Hanna topoloia topolai!

<strong>Re: Wiki Wacky!</strong>
<P>It's collaborative, yes. Thus you would not only read it, you'd *write* it as well. I'm not sure how it would fit in with a forum, if at all. And there's no way to ensure, with the little Wiki script I have, that some ass isn't going to come in and delete everything. No version control, no password protection, etc.
<P>But it'd be entertaining, to say the least. I think I'll set something up, anyway, and see what you all do with it.
<P>&quot;Wiki wiki&quot; is Hawaiian for &quot;quick&quot;. It's a quick way to make web pages.

<P>Since it was a fun film, I cut giant swaths of slack on the scientific accuracy. For everything they did right (my favorite example - the lander used the exact same touchdown method as Pathfinder did back in 1997. It could almost be a film of the pathfinder landing in fact), they did ten things wrong. A few that come to mind without even breaking a sweat:
<P>- The geneticist (Played by Robert Sizemore), when pompously enumerating the &quot;four letter alphabet&quot; he works in, gets one of the four letters wrong. He said &quot;A, T, G, P&quot;, when any high-school biology student knows it's &quot;A, T, G, C&quot;.
<P>- Mars has a datum (sea level equivalent when you have no seas) level total atmospheric pressure equivalent to about 100,000 feet altitude on earth; less than 5% of earth's sea-level pressure. Even if all of that miraculously became oxygen, it still wouldn't be breathable, even for a moment. You might as well be in space. They also talk about the ice storms being a &quot;low pressure area&quot;, and state the pressure in hundreds of millibars. Huh?
<P>- They actually got the stats on Sojourner's transmitter correct (down to mentioning that it was based on an old 14.4K modem). Unfortunately though, Sojourner's trasmitting range could be measured in feet, not millions of miles. Pathfinder itself (seen briefly) did all the talking to home, via a largish high-gain dish antenna. None of the gear in either piece could possibly talk to home when carried around. Also, the batteries on both units are very, very, dead, and not rechargable anymore even today. The final death of the batteries are what ended the pathfinder mission.
<P>- The ship was beautiful, taken directly from NASA concept paintings. But as Michael said, a spinning section doesn't act like articifical gravity. It won't quickly turn on and off, falling objects would tend to follow a very noticeable curved path, and the vast majority of the ship would still be in zero G.
<P>- They did a fair job with the &quot;AI&quot; systems. I thoroughly enjoyed how stupidly the ship's systems reacted to speech. On the other hand, AMEE was far too competent a system, in just about every way. It (she) may as well have been T1 without Arnold wrapped around the skeleton. Sorry folks, robots like that are many nobel prizes away.
<P>- No animal life we know of *produces* oxygen. Sure the mars surface radiation would make for lots of mutations, but a) it's not a survival trait for the nematodes. If they produce it, they don't need it to breathe, and b) nothing like that is going to develop without tens of thousands of years of evolution in something as complex as an insect. Molds and bacteria evolve lots faster (it's easy when your generation time can be as short as a half hour), but they aren't as photogenic.
<P>- The impression was that something was going bad on earth, and Mars was being terraformed. Good luck with just some blue-green algae - it would die within minutes. The generally accepted technique would be to bomb mars with comets for a couple hundred years first, then start seeding with plants. The whole process would take more than 1000 years. Planets are big places.

<P>The solar panels were used to recharge the batteries on pathfinder and sojourner. They never had enough power to run much of anything by themselves.
<P>I can't recall the wattage used on the high-gain transmitter, but it took about two square yards of solar panel to keep pathfinder charged, and the transmitter was by far the biggest load.

<P>Stupid in the sense of extremely literal, and totally unable to cope with extraneous comments. As I said, I thought that part was dead-on target. As for robots being as advanced as depicted in 20 years, they said the same thing in 1980, and you can't even get one to do a decent job of mowing the lawn, let alone trusting them with deadly force.
