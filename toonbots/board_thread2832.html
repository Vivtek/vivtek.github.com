<strong>Hey Michael</strong>
<P>What I posted on the ecartoonist group was supposed to be a multi-language pun that only you would get. I found out I failed, because
<P>-the word for horse is ló, not lol. It always sounded like lol to me, thus LOL could be the basis for a pun. But no.
<P>-Ló fasz is more crude than I meant. I think I wanted balfasz, one translation of which is 'jerk.'
<P>Sorry for my failed, offensive multi-language pun.
<P>I like the truck labelled MUP in the current ToonBots. I always thought it was more high-tech looking than that, but I never saw it up close.

<P>And reason #3: my wife, good Catholic atheist girl that she is, never, ever, ever curses in Hungarian. English, sometimes, yeah, but that's different. So I have great gaps in my vocabulary where off-color is concerned.
<P>I figured you were going for some Hungarian pun, of course.
<P>&gt; Sorry for my failed, offensive multi-language pun.
<P>That's cool, you jerk.
<P>&gt; I like the truck labelled MUP in the current ToonBots. I always thought it
<BR>> was more high-tech looking than that, but I never saw it up close.
<P>It is not MUP. It is MIR in Cyrillic letters. The song is a peace song, so the red truck has &quot;PEACE&quot; on it in Russian. And after posting the episode I realized that (besides the Jihad heads) it's the first element of Toonbots I'd actually drawn, darn it. Sometimes the pressure of the storyline just makes me throw the constraints to the winds. Sigh.

<P>magyar sounds promising - i'm sure i've heard that before (wasn't magyar zsa zsa gabor's mother or sister or something?)
<P>utanzo now - that was a movie, right? utanzo's raid? - except i think that was apaches.

<P>This entire thread has devolved into sheer gibberish -- even in comparison with normal &quot;reality&quot; for this forum.
<P>1. Magyar = Hungarian, in Hungarian.
<P>2. Utanzo = Imitator, or &quot;aper&quot;, from &quot;to ape&quot; (very clever, Mr Schissel)
<P>3. Monkey = majom.
<P>4. Hungarian monkey = magyar majom.
<P>5. Hungarian ape = magyar ... majom, apparently.
<P>6. Hungarian apes = magyar majmok.
<P>Lofasz = a certain part of a male horse's anatomy.
<P>Lohere = a very closely related part of the male horse's anatomy, OR clover. Go figure.

<P>Nyark, nyark. &quot;Utanzo magyar&quot; would actually mean &quot;an imitating Hungarian&quot;... or &quot;aping Hungarian&quot;. Close but no cee-gar.

<P>Ló means 'horse.'
<P>Fasz is a part of his anatomy. That I wouldn't call Michael. Maybe someone else on the ecartoonist board, but not Michael.

<BR>> the red truck has &quot;PEACE&quot; on it in Russian.
<P>i hate to say this now, but i thought it was funnier as MUP, what with all the cartoonists. (i just thought you just couldn't make 'u's too well)
<P>(especially now that i know MUP not only stands for 'Master of Urban Planning' but also 'Ministarstvo Unutrasnih Poslova' - i love online dictionaries)
<P>mir is good though too - especially combined with the 'implements of destruction'
<P>&gt; And after posting
<BR>> the episode I realized that (besides the Jihad heads) it's the first
<BR>> element of Toonbots I'd actually drawn, darn it. Sometimes the pressure of
<BR>> the storyline just makes me throw the constraints to the winds. Sigh.
<P>well, you were after all somewhat corrupted by the crossover (i mean, technically, _anyone_ drawing stuff is cheating).
<P>however i have just been playing with microsoft paint, and i am wildly impressed with your truck. my attempts come out looking like something done by a brain-damaged chimp. (not that i'm a great artist drawing with something other than a mouse)

<P>But .. but ... I think I'm missing something here. What's funny about MUP?
<P>&gt; mir is good though too - especially combined with the 'implements of
<BR>> destruction'
<P>It's the incongruity of all these dead Communists (and not-so-dead, in Fidel's case) driving around in a Russian peacenik van! Oh, never mind. Whatever you find funny in it is good enough for me.
<P>&gt; well, you were after all somewhat corrupted by the crossover (i mean,
<BR>> technically, _anyone_ drawing stuff is cheating).
<P>...
<P>That's true. I overcame those qualms, though, so I guess I shouldn't worry about it too much.
<P>&gt; done by a brain-damaged chimp.
<P>Yes, Paint is not for the weak of heart.
