<P>Actually, I think it might be just me in particular who sucks... I need to start posting more! Just look at those standings! You may think you've won, Jenn, but I will not be usurped!
<P>Usurp's a funny word, isn't it? Usurp usurp usurp.
<P>Hard to type repeatedly, too.

<strong>The following in mime...</strong>
<P>I did this post first in mime, but some irate random personages beat me up and laughed at my face paint. So I had to resort to letters again.
<P>1) I go away for one weekend and come back to not only a flurry of activity on the board, and to top that off, not one but /two/ new comics! I'll be gone for a week at the end of the month, try not to overrun the buffers of the server (maybe that could happen and if you all weren't such cool computer geeks, I might get away with it. But feel free to let me know if it's impossible or something...) while I'm on vacation, huh?
<P>2) I think you and I are ignoring the bigger issue, Napolean...the true enemy of the state/Toonbots forum...Tirdun. Look at all those posts! Clearly, we should join forces against this menace to posting ratings. Now, since we have very nearly the same name, if we call all our posts the entity of Jen*...we'd have 54 posts. Still not enough, but if we go to his house and tie him to a chair, and then maybe defenestrate the chair, we might have a chance. Oh, that and chop off his fingers cause you know he'd use his teeth to drag his chair to the nearest internet cafe and post at least thirty times on the injustice of it all. At least that way, he'd have to type with his nose and it might slow him up enough that we could catch up.
<P>Jenn. Who is joking and absolutely not contemplating violence toward another Jihad member. Just a Jihaad member.

<strong>/Really/ scary</strong>
<P>Okay, you want to hear something /really/ scary?
<P>I apparently was making some kind of computer joke and didn't even know it. I didn't catch it at Michael's post yesterday and it wasn't until I read Pooga's that something started to dawn on me.
<P>I'm guessing that I am so completely un-computer geek that I automatically emit a field of anti geek particles around myself, causing all computer related things to bounce off of me.
<P>Jenn &lt;-- funny and didn't even know it.

<P>Of course, Gally probably would have included some moral regarding the healthy and rejuvinating value of intoxicating beverages, or something. Still, good show, my dear Poog, eh, what! Capital, capital. Er, quite

<P>And if we dunk him in ink before defenestrating him, we can use him to draw Dot and Bot on the lawn! We can also take off his shoes so they won't let him into the internet cafe, which I assume would operate under the holy trinity of No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service. He can keep his shirt, though. I'm not particularly interested in going around undressing my fellow Jihad members.

<P>Oh, come now, Napolean, don't be so modest! You're an /artist/, I'll bet you could manage a full scale Mao. We might have to keep redipping him, but I figure his landlord won't mind a swimming pool full of india ink on the lawn. Who would, really?
<P>It's possible that the very people who instituted the trinity of No's might well be members of this nefarious Jihaad. I sense a circular plot. Yeeeeesssss....
