<strong>Of players and why they should be alone.</strong>
<P>I just read something that made me wish I had a uterus so I could be kicked in the stomach to prevent a poor child from coming into a world that allows a heap of yak dung like PvP to exist.
<P>My normal stringent standards forces me to much through at most two weeks worth of output from the dreck that people consider entertainment. In this case, I made an exception because my stomach was wretching at the sight of the homepage. The whole basis of Player versus Player is fisting. No joke.
<P>You see, when you open up your browser and head on over to PvP, you are getting bent over and fisted before you can even say: &quot;thank you sir may I have another&quot;. Scott Kurtz has managed to do what I thought was impossible, at least for people not named Corey Marie Kitley. If you do not get that last part, well I'm glad, because I probably hate you and hope your children step in front of a bus and get run over.
<P>Anyhow, I see PvP and I think Pategonian yak vomit. Why? First and foremost, anyone who uses Short Circuit as a source of humor is obivously the reason they should begin to look into qualifying heats at the Special Olympics. A Steve Guttenburg movie as an inspiration? Just bring on the end of the world already, because there is nothing worth saving. Another thing about PvP, it is video game humor. Talk about pandering to the largest group of idiots, people who can only find something funny because it references the newest l337 game out on the market.
<P>It must be the hip thing to do to talk about Dark Ages of Camelot or something. I just read more of the archieves and came to the conclusion that the only thing that can save the comic is to destroy the comic. It's low bar humor makes me wonder if life is worth living at all? Oh wait, farther back PvP takes a potshot at Sinfest. Ooh, he's edgy. Next thing he'll be talking about how Star Wars... oh he just did. Can the pot get more pissed in? Mocking a comic when yours has all the creativity and interest garnering capabilities of a very dead squirrel makes a good case for state mandated post-birth abortions. Kurtz not only manages to retread moronic geekdom humor, but he does so in a way that makes Pluggers look like an edgy, biting comic.
<P>All in all, I think I should go back to my mountain cabin, grab my aught six, and reenact Ruby Ridge.

<P>All the same, many thanks. I've always felt... prejudiced... for giving Msr. Kurtz's outpourings a WIDE berth. Now I feel... still prejudiced, but - vindicated... ?!?

<P>Just because Ilya agrees with you doesn't mean you're right. Cooler, maybe, but not right.
<P>I personally like PvP and I'm truly amazed at Kurtz's ability to wangle it into a living -- a real success story.
<P>Then again, I like Garfield, so as a Web toon personality, I suck.

<P>I've been following Garfield the last few weeks and caught myself laughing occasionally. What -has- been getting into me? Odd. I mean, I've always been odd, but not -that- odd. I think.
<P>(Or has Messr. (got it right that time. Ha!) Davis actually begun to figure out humor? Could be.) I've tended to believe in &quot;de gustibus&quot; etc., anyhow... (have to, survival's sake, tastes differing as much as mine etc. Especially musically...)
<P>Anyhow, I tend to think that very little outside of the field I &quot;started&quot; in can &quot;mean&quot; that I'm right, really... though quite a bit can mean that I'm wrong (real-life games of minesweeper somehow come to mind here, but now I'm getting morbid.)

<strong>Re: Of players and why they should be alone.</strong>
<P>Weeellll....
<P>I don't like Garfield, though I must say I haven't read it recently. I /used/ to like Garfield back in the day. Ya know. Before the vast majority of you were born. I'm so alone. I think Michael was alive then. Anyways. My point wasn't to be old again.
<P>I like PvP, but I do have to admit that I'm not a gamer, and I usually don't understand the references to games. So I suppose I could see where someone who does know about games might get pissy about it. Cause if it's dumbed down enough so that I still think it's funny, it's probably not particularly funny to someone who knows anything about the field.
<P>(I really hope this doesn't post twice. I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose!)
