<BR>> interviewed. Sweet Jesus, he is a total lying ass.
<P>he's a politician. i always found it interesting how much he was lionized after 9/11....considering how much people hated him before that.
<P>but that line he has about saying (on 9/11) &quot;thank god george bush is president&quot;...man, that's just pathetic.
<P>hey, what was that think about residents of puerto rico? can you not vote absentee?
<P>....well, you can't _now_, of course...but could you not have?

<P>As vocal as I am, you'd think I would have done my homework in advance, but they won't mail absentee ballots to PR. I could have had it mailed somewhere else, but there was just too much going on. And of course, Indiana went 60% Bush anyway -- they are a thoroughly red state, except for Bloomington.

<P>ah, but there are always those other offices on the ballot.
<P>not that that always helps, of course. my idiot congressman, who didn't even bother to come to the district to campaign, and has made an art form of ignoring his constituents, still got twice as many votes as his very hardworking competitor.
<P>still, two years is plenty of time to plan....if we're all still here in two years.
<P>no, i'm handling the election results just fine - not depressed at all. why do you ask?

<P>::wolverines eat post-election depression and paranoia, and wave half gnawed signs reading &quot;BoxJam in '08!&quot;::

<P>BoxJam's a uniter, not a divider!
<P>Oh, and The Incredibles is magnificent, even at a midnight screening (Star Wars &quot;Episode III&quot; trailer, not so much, but the army of cheering Wookies was amusing).
