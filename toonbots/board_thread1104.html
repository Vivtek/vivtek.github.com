<strong>Holy Mackerel</strong>
<P>The 03/01 episode was a *bear* to draw! Must have taken me a good half-hour to get the eyes right! Good thing I was doing it in the background while working on a client site.
<P>I love my life.

<P>Maybe it would've gone faster if you directed more of you attention towards it.
<P>And thanks to the ability to download communism from the Internet, I'm now listening to even more Croation words that I don't understand. yay me!

<P>Sounds nice, though I have no clue what they're singing about. They could be singing about the foolish American who was tricked into thinking that this thing's a love song for all I know. But other than my ignorance of the language, it is indeed a rather pretty-sounding song.

<P>Nah, nah, they're singing, roughly, &quot;You're the desire of my life/You're my desire, I know/In life, in life/I have only you/something something/because you're the desire of my life/because you're my sweetness.&quot;
<P>God, that sounds stupid in English, but the scansion and rhyming in Croatian make it work.

<strong>Re: Holy Mackerel</strong>
<P>&gt; sounds nice, although I do not have a point of reference, which approximately they sing. They
<P>knew &gt;, over the stupid American, that to the betrogen into thinking &gt; the Liebesong of this thing
<P>for all, became those, i-white to sing. But differently as than my ignorance of &gt; the language, it
<P>indeed rather pretty pretty, is a Song sounding. Close, close, sing it approximately &quot; it are desire
<P>my life span / it are my desire, life, which I know / in, in life/I have it / somewhat something /,
<P>because, which you the desire my life span / are, because, you are only my sweet &quot;, God, tone on
<P>English stupid, but scansion and the Reimen in the forms Croatian it functions
