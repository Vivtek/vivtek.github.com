<strong>New glasses</strong>
<P>So I got sick of the scratched lenses on my old glasses, and the frames have never really been the same since my son proudly showed me how he'd turned them into a pretzel this summer, so I went and got new glasses. To the tune of a painful $390. But (this is weird) they had a buy-one-get-one-free special on. This is starting to sound like a dream narration, but it's true.
<P>The really neat thing? I can now clean my glasses *while wearing glasses*. It's really easy to get the dang things clean now.
<P>Just had to tell *somebody* how happy that makes me.

<P>Woo! I CAN SEE! ISSA MIRACLE! I get new specs every other year or so. My eye-doc loves my insurance rider.

<P>I'll take your word for it :)
<P>So, how blind are you? I asked my doctor last year what my numbers were (ie: 20/20, 20/40, 20/80 etc) and he told me, no joke, &quot;At some point the numbers really don't mean anything anymore&quot;. I was stunned. He finally gave me &quot;around 20/4000&quot; which means I see at 2 feet what most people can see at a half mile. I can read 12pt Times font at 4 inches. Ye gods I'm blind.

<P>ouch! you make me feel better about mine....although actually mine are pretty good now - broke down and did the laser surgery thing last year - it's truly amazing to open your eyes in the morning and actually be able to _see_.

<P>I'm not nearly as bad as Tirdun -- I can (barely) function without glasses at the cost of a lot of squinting. My astigmatism, though, is very bad.
<P>I ... think I'll wait to do laser surgery until they can repair the damage they sometimes do. It's real tempting, but I don't relish the thought of losing my tear glands (which can indeed sometimes happen.)

<P>yeah - you need to be sure you have a really good surgeon, with lots of experience - it's pricier than the $500/eye mall places, but this is definitely a case where it is worth spending a little more.

<P>I felt nervous getting my ear pierced in the mall... I don't think I'm going to let them shoot lasers into my eyes.

<P>when you put it _that_ way, it does sound pretty bad....actually, it sounds like a business butch would get into!

<P>I'm not sure where my eyesight is anymore. At one point, it *was* twenty-twenty, but gradually deteriorated. Only needed glasses since around 1998, though, and haven't had them changed since (though they were scratched ever so slightly in the accident.) Can see adequately without them, but outlines are blurred somewhat, and cannot read any average sized print further than about a foot away, nor can I watch television clearly without them, unless I'm sitting directly in front of the screen, like I do in front of the computer monitor. Could mostly function without them if forced to, unless I had to attend classes or anything else which would require me to read from a distant blackboard or screen or whatnot, as even squinting does little for me now.

<strong>Re: New glasses</strong>
<P>it's the curse of the academic lifestyle (well, that and the joys of getting older). i always figured the great thing would be to be able to go camping and lie in your sleeping bag looking up at the stars without optical enhancement. now i can do that - but now i never seem to have time to go camping (and the idea of lying around on the cold hard rocky ground has rather less appeal). which just goes to show....something.
