<strong>A very deep question.</strong>
<P>&quot;If you get thrown out a window, are you a defenestratee? or a defenstrator? defenestratage? defenestratant? What about the person who threw you? What about any person you might have landed on? &quot;
<P>Brought to by the random quotes from hamsterrepublic.com. And most certainly not just an excuse for me to make another post. Nope.

<strong>Re: A very deep answer</strong>
<P>Curry can be too spicy for sensitive stomaches. Always had a mild fondness for the quagga myself. Besides, stripes, even only on half of one's body, do add a certain elegance.
<P>Speaking of wildlife, though, did anyone else catch the Animal Planet documentary &quot;Wolverine: Devil of the North,&quot; which aired yesterday? Unfortunately shaved the last couple minutes off when I recorded it (incuding credits), but was pleasant and instructive. The insertion of silent film footage of the noble wolverine was one of the highlights.

<P>huh?
<P>i saw (parts) of it (was running in and out of the kitchen doing dishes). missed the silent footage, but the stuff with the baby wolvies was wonderful - they really _are_ playful little things! as i recall, they were the subject of the last segment - they have to go back into captivity, and the woman who was raising them said they would probably forget all about her pretty quickly because they were becoming increasingly self-assured and independant (although at the moment they still liked to sleep with their blankies). all in all, pretty good show.

<P>if you got that far, i think all you missed were a bunch of ads and the credits (which you probably wouldn't have gotten to see anyway - [rant] what is the deal with the incredible shrinking credits these days? watched hallmark's mark twain's &quot;roughing it&quot;, eagerly awaited the credits because there were a number of non-famous, but still good actors - only to see them squished to mini-type to make screen room for ads (like there weren't enough during the show). even e-mailed hallmark, and they could only give me 4 names - well, one of them was eric roberts, who _was_ bothering me, cause i knew he was familiar - but that was a _much_ smaller part than higby, and they didn't tell me who he was. and if they don't shrink them, they run them by at light speed - guess they assume everyone has wall-size tv's and tivo to slow the action...

<P>I had a wall-sized tivo once, does that count? It was huge, back when they first came out before all that newfangled miniturization. Size of a buick...
<P>Ok, I didn't, but once I had a VAX, it was in my cube at one job. It made a good heater and you could point to it and go &quot;yep, it's a VAX&quot; and people would either give you an odd look or boggle. Then there was a full-height SCSI hard drive I had, it was 300 MB and about the size of a brick. If you powered it on, it made a killer &quot;jet starting up&quot; sound and if you picked it up it was just like holding a gyroscope. A big, angry gyroscope.

<P>wow - for some reason i always assumed those were more room-sized (well, they're old, and with the name VAX - i mean, doesn't it just conjure images of vast, evil, planet-controlling computers?). somehow having one you could point to in a cubicle seems like having a pit bull puppy - sure, it's cute _now_, but just wait.....

<P>i love computers with appropriate sound effects. used to have one at my old job that made this sort of chirping sound. it had a turbo button you could hit when you wanted it to run faster; when you hit it a red light came on. (as i recall, it predated the 286 - so even at best, it more strolled.) i told everyone it was powered by gerbils; the red light showed you were heating up their little wheel, and that was why it ran faster.

<P>Actually, was a failed attempt to post a marginal minimal wolverine facsimile, only to be thwarted by the fact that this forum does not redognize proper columns, spacing, or other formatting in the text it sends.
<P>&gt;[rant]
<BR>> what is the deal with the incredible shrinking credits these days? watched
<BR>> hallmark's mark twain's &quot;roughing it&quot;, eagerly awaited the
<BR>> credits because there were a number of non-famous, but still good actors -
<BR>> only to see them squished to mini-type to make screen room for ads (like
<BR>> there weren't enough during the show). even e-mailed hallmark, and they
<BR>> could only give me 4 names - well, one of them was eric roberts, who _was_

<BR>> shrink them, they run them by at light speed - guess they assume everyone
<BR>> has wall-size tv's and tivo to slow the action... [/rant])
<P>I share your sentiments in regards to end credits. Honestly wonder if this is any more effective than the long-standing (and comparatively less intrusive) method of having a voice-over announcer describe the next show (something which a handful of networks still do for some programming.) Been watching a lot of TVLand lately, and while the bumpers which present little trivia or background on performers, plot, or writers in the upcoming episode of the next show can be fun at times (and Harry Shearer is the announcer for them), I dislike the fact that they split the screen to do so, thus ruining thr original &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; credits and sometimes, with certain ads, over-riding the ending theme as well. The speed problem, however, I cope with by simply sparing a few minutes on a given blank tape for the credits, and then go back through them with the pause button. Don't have the Hallmark Channel here, so unable to see the Mark Twain production myself, but if I ever see it on video or whatnot, I'll be sure and copy the credits and post them here for you. Of course, IMDB has a fallible, incomplete cast list (which does include aforementioned Eric Roberts, as &quot;The Foreman&quot;), but no identification for a character named Higby (a few actors are listed but not identified by role, however.) Interesting to note that veteran Canadian character player/voice actor Wayne Robson was in the cast, though.

<strong>Re: A very deep answer indeed</strong>
<P>&gt; &gt; silent film footage of the noble wolverine
<P>&gt; ....
<P>11 - film is solely about, by, and for wolverines; wolverines have all speaking parts (humans lip-synch to placate human-centred expectations); NO PENGUINS APPEAR, ESPECIALLY NOT ANY UNTITLED ARMED FRONTS (note: fronts are flippered, and do not appear. backs are marginally tailed (likewise))
<P>Alas! that to me cometh not this fine flick. Perhaps by summer I'll have cable, when they begin (by popular demand (on pain of gnawing and assorted mayhem)) the six-month run-up to an Oscars all-categorical sweep!
