<strong>Penguin hierarchy</strong>
<P>Ah, penguins, my favorite animals (though I haven't tried Pokey the Penguin and am not at all sure I should.) A question (and I'm sorry if it's been asked before- erm, no I'm not, just accept the big smile on my face as a target :) ) - a question in jest (ducks and hides) - when -did- the penguins (or this particular group of them) replace their Empire with a Kingdom, and what were the circumstances surrounding this singular event? *g* -Eric Schissel (more a horse than a flightless bird, but Up with Emperor Pen*MMMPPPPHHHH!*)
<P>Oh, hello, Mr... 'sthat a wolverine? Looks like it might be from here, but I can't be sure. I was just going! Don't let me detain you. Eep!

<P>Well, duh. When they realized that &quot;I am a Penguin Emperor&quot; is hard to rhyme.
<P>So, Eric, you seem to have succumbed to the Toonbots Dark Side at last, eh? I figured we'd suck you in eventually.

<P>Not to mention that I -did- notice there's some parody or other involved here, though my relatives the G&amp;S fans would know better than I would, I believe. ;)

<strong>I'm so lost...</strong>
<P>Horrible puns! Can we keep him?
<P>Just in case any members of the Jihad had a bet going...it only took me to the end of his post to realize that was a pun!
<P>So ummm...since everyone seems to know who this Eric guy is...I did a search on his name and there was a lot of stuff about Russian composers but I couldn't find anything on a comic anywhere. I thought you had to be a cartoonist to read Toonbots. (or a clueless receptionist who's routinely lost)
<P>If we do keep him, does that mean he takes over my spot in the wolverine den? Can I move to the area behind the stove?

<P>Hrm- the cat's real, actually (though, as I think I mentioned, not mine.) I do make the occasional pun, but if there was a pun in my post it was unintentional. Please enlighten! :)

<P>I found Toonbots in a link in one of Brother Emsworth's posts to another forum, if memory serves, some while back; just didn't get around to reading the entire archives until now. Unfortunately, no, I'm not a webcartoonist (or any other kind of cartoonist) though I did years ago briefly consider writing something for the mailing list &quot;Superguy&quot;, shared-universe parody superhero fiction with a comic-book atmosphere...
<P>Entirely appropriate that you would have found pages on Russian composers, since classical music is probably my main obsession, and I've written at least three webpages (one of them a big one) on the music of various Russian or ex-Soviet composers, and others on other musical topics besides. Hobby of mine...

<P>Awww, how sweet, the wolvies like you already! Pleasure to see you here, Schissel, old horse. Feel free to state your opinions or provide detailed information of your reactions to Toonbots for future propoganda study.

<P>Gladly, and thank you. I look forward to! I suppose the sum total of all this, though, means that there is no chance of Michael regaling us with a tale of the Great Penguin Revolt of 1850, in which a group of valorous Adelie Penguins replaced (at great cost- oh dear, I am overdoing this just a bit) a corrupt Emperor with a Constitutional Monarchy, whence the Penguin King of Cartoon. Webcomic and Lore? No, I suppose not. 'Twas but a futile hope. :) In the event, looking forward to the next episode. -Eric beating a hasty retreat.

<P>Hmm. I kind of like that. Unfortunately, it sounds like work.
