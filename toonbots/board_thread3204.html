<P>um.....technically speaking.....doesn't midnight Wednesday happen tonight some time? although i am (as always) amazed at your control of time - 2 (two) episodes since i checked in yesterday! (well....1-1/2, anyway). brilliant productivity! and as soon as i recover my breath (taken from me by the speedy flight of these epistles), i will comment on the subtle genius of combining those two iconic figures, napoleon and the bear in the hat. (i did get a chuckle out of the 'previously' end-tags - yes, clearly you are a time-master extraordinaire!)
<P>&gt; Minions! Caper for my amusement!
<P>gladly, master! *caper* *caper* *cap-*trip* *thud* *crash*.....
<P>(danged crickets, always underfoot)
<P>um, sorry about the lamp....and the wall.......

<P>Well, it was after midnight, so it was Wednesday. Or so my wife tells me. She'll get up at 1 and talk to me about stuff that happened &quot;yesterday&quot; and what she's going to do &quot;today&quot; -- perennially confusing.
<P>&gt; um, sorry about the lamp....and the wall.......
<P>They're insured.

<P>But trying to come up with adulatory comments and capering for your amusement is so much more fun!
<P>However, it's also harder than my normal life. I think I'll go to bed instead, which is far easier than any of the above.

<strong>Jiminy Cricket, animated by Ward Kimball</strong>
<P>Apart from finals and continuing illness (the fact that I've now begun bleeding whenever I have to blow my nose has done little to gruntle me), computer went out following an outage late last Wednesday (still haven't heard from the repair service, but it seems likely I may be incommunicado for an indefinite period due to this.) Posting this from school computer, having finished finals and awaiting transportation homeward. Still, amusing Toonbots, even if continuity in regards to the brand name has not been adhered to with strict and unerring faithfulness. Wonderful Napoleon cameo as well. Nice work, M. Roberts, and early Merry Christmas to the Jihad, until we (hopefully) meet again. (For those concerned, humble self will try to whisk off fthe wolverines during this festive time, provide holiday nuptials and diversions for the lovable horde, as soon as Usu completes the backstroke and towels off.)

<strong>Re: Jiminy Cricket, animated by Ward Kimball</strong>
<P>Feel better soon, g'sir. Your absence has been much 'marked upon, and you yourself, much missed! Season's Greetings to you as well.
<P>Hope that computer gets fixed soon too :)
<P>Very best from this horsey and though I say it, somewhat presumptuously, as shouldn't, all the gang...

<P>same for me, all along -- now that finals are over, hope you can curl up with a warm wolverine or three, and a nice hot toddy (or four), and feel better.
<P>speaking of wolverines -- holiday _nuptials_? to whom shall we send congratulations? (and you will of course post pictures (when your computer recovers)).
<P>merry christmas to you and the wolvies, and hope you all have fun!

<strong>Wedding Bells and Jingle Bells...</strong>
<P>Well, computer arrived back on Saturday, and seems to be in fairly stable condition at the moment, though still may need to clear a bit more space on the hard-drive.
<P>&gt; speaking of wolverines -- holiday _nuptials_? to whom shall we send
<BR>> congratulations? (and you will of course post pictures (when your computer
<BR>> recovers)).
<P>Pardon, slip of the mataphorical tongue, so to speak (was in a bit of a hurry that day.) The word for which I was groping was actually &quot;victuals&quot; (though I believe Athcu and Statu may have shared eyes on occasion.) As for pictures, possibly in the distant future, I hope, but my scanner/printer went out just days before the printer, and had to remove the entire program anyway to save space (having hooked up a substitute printer so as to complete my remaining papers.) May try re-installing later on, when the computer is stable enough to afford the necessary space, and assuming that scanner at least still works.)
<P>&gt; merry christmas to you and the wolvies, and hope you all have fun!
<P>And the same to you, o personage who during the coming days traditionally refrains from circular motions of kitchen utensils within cups or bowls of various liquid, or also movement in general!

<P>thanks! - altho i gotta tell you, what with dealing with the relatives and all, 'cups and bowls of various liquids' is pretty much what gets me through.
