<strong>Reminder: Approachig Defenestration Anniversary</strong>
<P>Now that the Toon-O-Matic is in somewhat working order once more, and before go back to studying for finals (hopefully I can save my scholarship if I can oulll a B in Western Cultural Heritage), I thought I'd remind the esteemed meta-cartoonist that on May 23, 1618, Wilhelm Graf Slavata and Jaroslav Borzita Graf von Martinicz were thrown out of a window, an act which triggered the Hundred Years War. The 393rd anniversary of that day is a mere twenty days away, and we wouldn't want to forget a date whcih could be considered the PAFTWJ's primary holy day, now would we?

<strong>(Ahem) &quot;Approaching&quot; Defenestration Anni</strong>
<P>Dash it all! I always seem to be the most careless with typos on the one forum where I can't edit my posts. Ah, well.

<BR>> forum where I can't edit my posts. Ah, well.
<P>You know, if you work on proper typig skills, you'll find that mistakes are a thig of the past and that editig posts is a luxury you don't really need.

<P>Oh, go boil your head. Seriously, I took a typing course in high school, but I still type the most ghastly bloomers more often than I'd care to. And tomorrow I have a Spanish exam, spoken dialogue, but my partner didn't show up to finish practicing today, and now we'll have to rush it tomorrow morning! Plus, my aunt's in the hospital, and I'm stuck here at the libarry for a while, and still having trouble with the questions for my Western Cultural Heritage essays (that one's Friday), and terrified that I might lose my scholarship if I don't keep a B in there and Spanish, an A in Theatre (which shouldn't be hard, but I lost my textbook), and I'm sure no one here's interested in all that, but I needed to vent a bit, as I feel ike a toad beneath the harrow, as my soul is overwrought and the blasted sword of Damocles is hanging over my head.

<P>Mmmm, boiled head. Just like mom used to make.

<P>Ah, vent all you want, we'll endure it. You're among friends here.
