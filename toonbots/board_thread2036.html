<strong>Yet Again? (8/22/01)</strong>
<P>God bless my soul, Michael, this is something else. Keep this up, and you're right, you might not need to send out notification anymore! And now I'll have that song stuck in my head for awhile. Another rollicking installment, with that fine ensemble cast we've grown to know and love. And it seems only natural to associate Lenin with Pokey the penguin. The blurb wasn't as amusing as yesterday's, but then, that one was such a gem that it would be hard to top immediately. Capital, capital, capital, Michael, old thing! What ho!

<P>I was kinda thinking that a long blurb would divert from the (really quite large) comic, though...I'm paying a lot of attention to the words in the comic. And singing them in my head. And then humming and bouncing so that my coworkers think I'm insane. Anyways, I was going the route of 'what a genius balance! Long comic with lots of content, and short blurb to offset it.' Minimalist stuff and stuff. Kinda. Stuff.
<P>You know how scared I get when I express an opinion. Are those wolverines on the horizon?

<strong>Re: Yet Again? (8/22/01)</strong>
<P>I loved it. I'm seriously thinking about cutting just the top panels with Dubya and hanging them on my wall. The rest would be beyond the comprehension of the mere mortals in my office.

<strong>Look at all the comics! (8/24)</strong>
<P>Yah know....
<P>*eyes desk which she shares with the afternoon receptionist, who put up a comic drawn by someone else's 10 year old in probably 1975 that shows a poorly done Snoopy for every day of the week, and says things like 'Monday: &quot;Don't speak to me!&quot; and Tuesday: &quot;God, get me through this day.&quot; and which makes my brain bleed every single time I look at it*
<P>I could print out a Toonbots and put it up next to Snoopy. I wonder if the competing concepts would cause a rift in the (*gasp*) time-space continuum and give me less time to post on the forum. Hrm.
<P>You know...with the constant update rate Michael's got going, we really only have one day to discuss the new comic before there's a new one to digest. Could it be a plot? (No, every single thing is /not/ a plot, don't be silly. Though it is suspicious that you bring that up....)

<strong>Re: Look at all the comics! (8/24)</strong>
<P>i was just thinking... while the current pace is exhilarating, it does deprive one of the joys of savouring each strip over and over again (i could look at yesterday's for a week)
<P>as for your co-desk-habitor... after checking out the pokey the penguin link today, i think a few of those would provide a more appropriately subversive and twisted counterpoint.

<P>But mouse is in /no/ way saying that the current pace should decrease, right? Right? (Shhhh, mouse! We can savor during the next 16 day lag, kay?)

<P>Isn't Pokey /cute/? I was thinking about Pokey for a while, but see...now I can run off Toonbots /and/ Pokey in one handy comic! I did try this, by the way, but I can't figure out how to make it small enough to go on one page. Computers are my enemy. I'll bet some smart person tells me how soon.

<P>no no no (i always have the 'previous toon' link - and the feel of the wind through my ears is kinda fun)

<P>as a (reasonably) professional computer programmer person, i must inform you that computers _are_ the enemy; the better you get to know them, the clearer this will be to you. as to getting &gt; 1 comic/page - i would recommend 1) a copier with a reducing function, 2) scissors and 3) gluestick (good for endless hours of amusement by themselves)

<strong>Me and the computer thingie</strong>

<BR>> clearer this will be to you. as to getting &gt; 1 comic/page - i would

<BR>> gluestick (good for endless hours of amusement by themselves)
<P>Well, I did learn enough not to just hit buttons until the computer stops doing anything at all and moving the mouse around makes an interesting grinding sound come out of the CPU. That was helpful.
<P>See...but...I can only get the left half of the comic to print out at all. It seems like I could cut and paste it over somewhere or something, but I tried that in Word and I think that the supersecret icon thingies don't transfer. I'm sure there's a perfectly logical reason for this and that somewhere in the explanation the words 'platform' and 'Windows sucks' will appear. (largely because those two phrases seem to be in every single discussion that my husband has with me as to why the computer is spinning around on it's axis and regurgitating green pea soup /this time/)
<P>I could use the glue stick to accidentally paste used coffee cups, twizzle sticks, packets of sugar and other random break room garbage under the Snoopy cartoon, but I doubt it would have the same effect. Unless twizzle sticks have time vortex capabilities all their own. Hrm.
