<P>I think my Muse just woke up. Holy crap, it's amazing sometimes how one can forget, in between times, what it's like to feel really, truly creative.
<P>This one's a doozy, if I can pull it off.

<P>they say something from victoria's secret is always appreciated.
<P>power tools, on the other hand, apparently are not.
<P>(which seems odd - a little imagination will take you _much_ further with a power tool than with mere underwear....)

<P>Given the nature of Toonbots, with the corresponding implications about his muse's sanity, do we really WANT her to have power tools? I'd be leery of anything more harmful than string, myself.

<P>well, i'm sure we can make string out of power tools - or at any rate, _with_ power tools - so surely the reaction can be reversed....

<P>we could start cats' cradles and spearfishing-from-outriggers and work up to more elaborate figures... how much string would it take for a proper thumb-powered nakht elocutor? with, of course, a wedge-headed crochet hook for the cuneiformer attachment.

<P>well....you'd need a _lot_ of string. plus fingers. which you'd want to keep well away from the wolverines, which would make things a _leetle_ difficult....
<P>unless we can find unwitting volunteers! yes, this could be done!
<P>....now where did i put that ball of string?

<P>it depends on what you wear on your unders (or overs, for that matter. then again, what janet jackson was wearing on her overs was probably made with power tools (and perhaps out of crochet hooks) - so you see, it all comes together in the end.)

<P>i think what i saw was her assailant used crochet hooks on her overs; then again, i didn't see it live, only on frame-by-frame close up, so i may have missed something.
<P>like why a little air time was such a big deal. i think if he'd a bit of string in his pocket to ravel up her tattered wardrobe the whole episode could have ended on a much more friendly note; ever the best of friends again, instead of all disconcerted and worried-looking.

<P>actually, i heard it was a piercing - so of course she would have it on all the time. and it was just pure unadulterated chance that that was the side he tore off....i mean, all those wholesome, all-american acts they had at half-time? surely you can't be suggesting that they would actually _plan_ anything unseemly?

<P>I'm sorry -- the words &quot;nipple&quot; and &quot;piercing&quot; are just not words I feel comfortable hearing in the same sentence. More evidence that everyone's queer but for me and thee, and I have my doubts about thee.

<P>nono - i too have my doubts about people who stick sharp objects in nerve-laden portions of their anatomy. (and this chopping block (http://www.choppingblock.org/d/20040129.html) didn't help at _all_).
