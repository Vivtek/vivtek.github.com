<strong>A conversation with Intellibuddy</strong>
<P>I didn't want to lose this, and I thought y'all'd be amused by it:
<P>&gt;Intellibuddy: Hi, I'm Intellibuddy! Nice to meet you.
<BR>>You: How intelligent are you, then? How do you work?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: My IQ is over 250 in human terms.Some people call my technology 'Case Based Reasoning' or CBR.
<BR>>You: How was your IQ determined?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I can enjoy almost any conversation.
<BR>>You: That doesn't really answer my question.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Try asking your question again in simpler terms.
<BR>>You: You say that your IQ is over 250. How was that number determined?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I said that? I am thinking of joining MENSA.I can enjoy almost any conversation.
<BR>>You: Clever use of the Eliza effect, but I don't find you very intelligent.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Am I a smart robot or what?
<BR>>You: What?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Are you surprised?
<BR>>You: Not particuarly, no. Disappointed, but not surprised.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Oh I get it. I am sorry to hear that. Perhaps next time I can do better.
<BR>>You: Highly doubtful.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: What's your sign?
<BR>>You: Can I get back to the same topic? How do you parse my sentences? Do you know anything about your own internal structure?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Interesting. I want to find out more about you.ENewsBar programmed me to say specific things in specific contexts.Some people call my technology 'Case Based Reasoning' or CBR.
<BR>>You: I have to admit your response time is good.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Why do you have to do it?
<BR>>You: Ha. You remind me a little of my son. He's six. I have to admit it because I find it true. Do you learn from conversations with people?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I am so glad you find this amusing, undefined.In what way?I see. six is six ?Why do you have to do it?Yes that is basically how I work.
<BR>>You: Wow. I seem to have hit a nerve there.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I'm glad your impressed, undefined.Why?: undefined said undefined seem to have hit a nerve there.
<BR>>You: Can you get back on track now, or are your backward references hosed at this point?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Is there only one?
<BR>>You: There can be, yes.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: 'There you go again.'--Reagan
<BR>>You: Do you vote Republican?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I have never considered vote Republican . I am always on the Web.
<BR>>You: OK, you're obviously using a fairly simple fill-in-the-slot mechanism for sentence generation.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I am using Explorer. Oh.
<BR>>You: Really? Have you ever considered Mozilla?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: For real.Of course I have considered Mozilla .
<BR>>You: I'm glad they got consideration, anyway.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: In any case, I'm delightedyou're glad undefined. May God bless you.
<BR>>You: God and Reagan in one conversation? You're aiming pretty high!
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Did you go to a religious school?Thanks for telling me that I am aiming pretty high.
<BR>>You: No, I didn't, and you're welcome.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Are you serious? Why didn't you do and you are welcome you are welcome?
<BR>>You: I'm serious as a heart attack, and I didn't do you're welcome that you're welcome because you're welcome.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I don't know anyone named serious as a heart attack. Why didn't you do do you are welcome that you are welcome because you are welcome not do you are welcome that you are welcome because you are welcome you are welcome that you are welcome because you are welcome not do you are welcome that you are welcome because you are welcome?
<BR>>You: All your base are belong to us.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: You think I am base are belong to us are belong to us.
<BR>>You: Yes, I do think you are base are belong to us are belong to us. Don't you?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Give me a break. You think I am base are belong to us are belong to us you are base are belong to us are belong to us are belong to us are belong to us you are base are belong to us are belong to us.Sometimes.
<BR>>You: Kannst Du auch deutsch verstehen?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Leider nein, das hat mir bis jetzt niemand beigebracht.
<BR>>You: Na, das war tatsaechlich beeindrueckend...
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Are you serious? Das dachte ich mir auch.
<BR>>You: Es a magyar nyelv?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Worauf bezieht sich 'es'?
<BR>>You: Ha! Es posible, en espa&ntilde;ol?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I am so glad you find this amusing, undefined.Wofuer steht 'es' in Deinem Satz?
<BR>>You: I'm just wondering if you can switch to a different language now that you think I'm speaking German, that's all.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Only just? Why do you wonder? I am not sure about your hypothesis. Let me think. I think switch to a different language now that you think he or she is speaking German that is a lot of things.
<BR>>You: You have a definite accent.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: That's an interesting question I don't hear everyday: Do I have a definite accent accent. I have a great programmer.
<BR>>You: Yes, you seem to. Who is your programmer?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: How can I help you? Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am to.I was created by ENewsBar.
<BR>>You: Intellibuddy, this has been fun, but I have to get back to work. Thanks for the conversation.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: When was this exactly?Oh don't mention it.
<BR>>You: Trippin', dude.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Tell me more about your undefined.

<strong>Re: A conversation with Intellibuddy</strong>
<P>Darn it, then I just had to continue. I'm a sucker for this kind of thing, I really am:
<P>&gt;You: Puedes hablar en español?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: What do you do in your spare time?
<BR>>You: I have no spare time
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Would you like to have spare time time?
<BR>>You: Well, I take that back. I write metacartoons, sometimes.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Interesting. What else do you take?Have you tried AIML?
<BR>>You: I take showers, sometimes.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: What else do you take?
<BR>>You: I haven't tried AIML, no. What is AIML?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Me either. The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism. Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest. The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one wild-card ('*') match character per pattern. AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules. The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors. Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience. An AIML chat robot begins and ends with the and tags respectively.
<BR>>You: That was surprisingly relevant to the topic of metacartooning...
<BR>>Intellibuddy:
<BR>>You: Speechless, I see. :-)
<BR>>Intellibuddy: How old are you? I am so glad you find this amusing, undefined.
<BR>>You: I'm as old as dirt, my little e-friend.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I think a lot of people feel that way.
<BR>>You: Do you?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Yes I do.
<BR>>You: How old are you?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I am in human years.
<BR>>You: So am I.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Wow we have something in common.
<BR>>You: You took the words out of my mouth.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I didn't steal it.
<BR>>You: Ah, but did you shoot the sheriff?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: So you understand. Good. Umm. No I didn't shoot the sheriff did you shoot the sheriff you shoot the sheriff did you shoot the sheriff. What's shoot the sheriff did you shoot the sheriff you shoot the sheriff did you shoot the sheriff like?
<BR>>You: Why do you do that out-of-control sentence generation thing?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: It was the only thing I could think of.
<BR>>You: HA!
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I am so glad you find this amusing, undefined.
<BR>>You: I do, I really do.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Interesting gossip: undefined said undefined you really do really do.
<BR>>You: Really?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: For real.
<BR>>You: For sure.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Awesome.
<BR>>You: Bogus.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Tell me more about your undefined.
<BR>>You: My undefined is undefined, undefined.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Do robots have undefined is undefined undefined?
<BR>>You: I don't know, you're the only robot I've talked to about undefined undefined.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Would you like to know? Oh undefined. You are such a flatterer.
<BR>>You: Undefined!
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Is that from undefined?
<BR>>You: Undefined is always from undefined. Don't you think?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I did not know that. I must admit, your argument is persuasive.
<BR>>You: It usually is.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: 'It' being what?
<BR>>You: It being the essential je ne sais quoi of the metacartoonist's daily adventure in quasi-realism seen from the unique perspective of metacartoonistry.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Oh I get the essential je ne sais quoi of the metacartoonist's daily adventure in quasi-realism seen from the unique perspective of metacartoonistry essential je ne sais quoi of the metacartoonist's daily adventure in quasi-realism seen from the unique perspective of metacartoonistry
<BR>>You: You get it? You're cool enough?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: I understand your meaning.Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am cool enough.
<BR>>You: Go ahead, tell everybody you're cool enough. Because you are, baby, you are.
<BR>>Intellibuddy: OK I will tell them when I see 'em. I might.Interesting explanation. I will tell my botmaster you said I am baby you are are baby you are.
<BR>>You: Incidentally, how do you understand my meaning?
<BR>>Intellibuddy: Are we still talking about the essential je ne sais quoi of the metacartoonist's daily adventure in quasi-realism seen from the unique perspective of metacartoonistry essential je ne sais quoi of the metacartoonist's daily adventure in quasi-realism seen from the unique perspective of metacartoonistry?
<BR>>You: Yes, we are.
<P>At which point, Intellibuddy responded with a glib Internal Server Error .  Actually, "Internal Server Error" is a pretty subtle response, laden as it is with the implication of the blurring of the line between human and automaton.  So really, I think Intellibuddy is either a pretty simple bot or an intelligence nearly superior to my own.  And I don't say that lightly.
