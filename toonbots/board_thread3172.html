<P>ooh ooh! i like it! i like it! i believe it perfectly captures my wide-eyed innocence, my serious thoughtfulness about the world, and my hopes for a cute nose! (altho the ears may be a bit big....ok, yeah, so are my _real_ ears, but still.....)
<P>and i _really_ like my cyborg name, courtesy of brunching shuttlecock:
<P>M.O.U.S.E.: Machine Optimized for Ultimate Sabotage and Exploration
<P>now _that's_ the real me -- sabotaging, exploring, exploring (maybe that's where the ears come in), sabotaging -- and all of it ultimately optimized. i may have to put this one up on my door. (i would, too, if i thought it would reduce the number of ignorant queries i get from passing fools)
<P>btw - for those of you who haven't had the time to investigate the site, i hereby report on some other relevant entitities: L.E.N.I.N.: Lifeform Engineered for Nocturnal Infiltration and Nullification (i mean, is that him to the life (death?) or what?) M.A.O.: Mechanical Artificial Organism (well.....) M.I.C.H.A.E.L.: Mechanical Intelligent Construct Hardwired for Assassination and Efficient Learning (you see why he likes the pickle crisp motto, it's so similar to his own: learn efficiently, or be eliminated)
<P>and of course: T.O.O.N.B.O.T.: Transforming Obedient Organism Normally for Battle and Online Troubleshooting
<P>(explains a lot, doesn't it?)
<P>this is what i love about toonbots - the opportunities to find strange new worlds in cyberspace, and even stranger ones in oneself.
<P>thanks, michael!
<P>[altho, eric, i must tell you -- you do keep me wondering about the _outside_ world. did a search for penfold and got: penfold music, penfold golf balls, penfold motor sports, penfold scottish fold cattery, and penfold books (homeopathy, charismatic movements and calvinism). so to:
<P>&gt; Which of us is Penfold?
<P>i must reply: huh?
<P>{and i am sure you will be quite lovely in michael's metaimaginings, you and your friend cleo both. i mean, you are a _herald_ - you'll probably have trappings and banners and even trumpets and stuff} {well -- maybe not} ]

<P>Well, mouse v 1.0 set me in mind of Beta Mouse (if only because I think most 1.0 products of a certain company tend to be Beta anyway) and that put me in mind of Dangermouse...

<BR>> not} ]
<P>Hrm... it would be ironic to tune to Toon bots one morn and find a reduced-size image of the late Trooper (who belonged to Patchwork, a therapeutic riding place near me) doing Quixotic things wouldn't it. But I will avoid at all costs giving Mr. Roberts ideas.
<P>Sincerely,
<P>Your Horsie knight of doleful countenance

<P>hmmm....now, _that's_ something i haven't tried.....maybe i could start with one of those mini-cannons......

<P>evil gigantic corporations shall remain nameless, due to requests from their lawyers....

<P>ok - i'm still lost, but i'll give you a pass, just cause 'Dangermouse' is such a great name.
<P>&gt; But I
<BR>> will avoid at all costs giving Mr. Roberts ideas.
<P>i'm afraid he gets way too many ideas just on his own....fortunately, he is somewhat limited by his drawing abilities.
<P>&gt; Sincerely,
<P>&gt; Your Horsie knight of doleful countenance
<P>now you will have me picturing you as the knight in 'through the looking glass' (admittedly one of my favorite characters) (although 'doleful countenance' is ringing a slightly different bell.......still, i believe you have potential as a white knight)
<P>(what was the name of the Herald in that book....it started with an 'H' - i think he was the one with the anglo-saxon attitudes.....drat, now i have something _else_ to reread)

<strong>Re: mouse v1.0</strong>
<P>&gt; hmmm....now, _that's_ something i haven't tried.....maybe i could start
<BR>> with one of those mini-cannons......
<P>Well, if you're going to start with something that won't work as a warning, may as well splurge and go for major firepower. (Erm, Eric, says Cleo the conscience, I -thought- you considered yourself a pacifist.) (Oh. We're not talking hypothetically? Pity, that...)
<P>&gt; evil gigantic corporations shall remain nameless, due to requests from
<BR>> their lawyers....
<P>Yes, for certain large values of request.
<P>&gt; ok - i'm still lost, but i'll give you a pass, just cause 'Dangermouse' is
<BR>> such a great name.
<P>a few spoilers to follow.
<P>TV show. Animated.
<P>&gt; i'm afraid he gets way too many ideas just on his own....fortunately, he
<BR>> is somewhat limited by his drawing abilities.
<P>Thank goodness for small favors, but they do seem to be improving by leaps and bounds. *sigh*
<P>&gt; now you will have me picturing you as the knight in 'through the looking
<BR>> glass' (admittedly one of my favorite characters) (although 'doleful
<BR>> countenance' is ringing a slightly different bell.......still, i believe
<BR>> you have potential as a white knight)
<P>Reference on my part to one of the main characters of a very famous, centuries-old and rather large novel that I have only just begun to read, will probably not finish before I need to return it to the library.
<P>Another spoiler: satire on the ideals of chivalry.
<P>I might be mistaken about this. I -think- that this is a reference to that character- I saw &quot;knight of the Doleful Countenance&quot; somewhere else entirely... but I expect I won't find myself mistaken as I go further into the novel...
<P>&gt; (what was the name of the Herald in that book....it started with an 'H' -
<BR>> i think he was the one with the anglo-saxon attitudes.....drat, now i have
<BR>> something _else_ to reread)
<P>Here I'm not at all sure- I probably don't know, anyway; most of the fictional Heralds I know of so far come from Mercedes Lackey novels (*very abashed look*)- such classics as I have read so far, haven't had many, or I've forgotten them.
<P>Hrm...

<P>well - i figure the time i take to aim it will give all but the dullest a chance to escape - and those that don't escape need to be removed from the gene pool.
<P>&gt; I might be mistaken about this. I -think- that this is a reference to that
<BR>> character- I saw &quot;knight of the Doleful Countenance&quot; somewhere

<P>ah, yes - maybe the exact reference depends on the translation. i applaud your initiative - this time of year, i'll be lucky if i actually manage to tackle 'through the looking glass'

<strong>hark, the herald messenger zings</strong>
<P>&gt; (what was the name of the Herald in that book....it started with an 'H' -
<BR>> i think he was the one with the anglo-saxon attitudes.....drat, now i have
<BR>> something _else_ to reread)
<P>in 'through the looking glass' there were two of them, hatta and haigha (rhymes with 'mayor'), but they were messengers, not heralds. haigha was the one i was thinking of, with the anglo-saxon attitudes (and there are some wonderful non-sequiters-of-meaning in _that_ section) - doubtless i called him a herald because he reminded me of the white rabbit, who _acted_ as herald in the knave's trial in 'wonderland' (although for that, i tend to remember walt kelly's illustrations, rather than tenniel's - so i see bun rabbit's dramatic reading of the verses) (and now i'll spend the evening singing 'deck us all with boston charlie' (to which, i am proud to say, i know both verses))
<P>gad, no wonder i can never find anything with all this jumbled up in my brain - i should take a weekend and clean it all out (along with the junkroom)
<P>anyway, knew you all were probably worrying about that.

<P>I got the Dangermouse reference! I loved Dangermouse -- it played on MTV back when (1) MTV was interesting and (2) I watched TV; the year 1986, it was. That and the Young Ones. That's television!
