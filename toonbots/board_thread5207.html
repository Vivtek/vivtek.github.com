<strong>Potentially Estate Violating Comic Re-Scan #1</strong>
<P>http://members.aol.com/Hungrywolverines/RacketyCoon.jpg
<P>Ah, Walt Kelly. This strip, from Pogo's first year, is still a classic. Fine shading, reactions, and cute gag without being overly cloying. Also proves that Kelly could be brilliant even without the linguistic maneuvers or political overtones, although they seldom hurt.
<P>

<P>you look at kelly's artwork, and you realize how much the newspapers have deprived us by shrinking the size of strips. no wonder so much of comic strip art now is rudamentary - no room for anything else.
<P>(was that the time when wiley cat and seminole sam were discussing making (rats, i can't even remember now) [SOMETHING] and possum PIE?) (one does get spoiled, having access to font sizes....)

<P>&gt; (was that the time when wiley cat and seminole sam were discussing making
<BR>> (rats, i can't even remember now) [SOMETHING] and possum PIE?) (one does
<BR>> get spoiled, having access to font sizes....)
<P>Parsnips and Possum Pie. (Pogo declines, claiming he's not too partial to parsnips, though Wiley assumes he must be just *wild* about possum).
<P>In a way, Pogo had more in common with Uncle Wiggily than most other animal based newspaper strips, if only that the baser desires for consumption were a recurrent theme (usually through Sam, Wiley, and old Sarcophagus MacAbre, the natural born buzzard), and though later sublimated somewhat by political machinations, it never quite died out.
<P>And now, for a change of pace, a couple of typically surreal moments from the classic 1932-1933 Mickey Mouse continuity, &quot;Blaggard Castle,&quot; in which Mickey and Horace Horsecollar are lured to the gothic abode of Professors Ecks, Doublex, and Triplex, who use their hypnotic ray to drive Horace insane and urge him to kill Mickey, leading to what is arguably one of Horace's finest performances: http://members.aol.com/Hungrywolverines/Horace1.jpg
<P>http://members.aol.com/Hungrywolverines/Horace2.jpg
<P>And less bizarre, but another fine Horace moment, as well as a reminder that at one point Mickey had a much stronger personality: http://members.aol.com/Hungrywolverines/HoraceClara.jpg

<strong>Re: Potentially Estate Violating Comic Re-Scan #2</strong>
<P>Actually, much of Albert's consumption, past the pre-strip Pogo comic books, was accidental (swallowing an amoeba, Mrs. Bullfrog's tadpole which Pogo was babysitting and had been left in a glass, frying the eggs which Owl was hoping to raise as presidential candidates, etc.)

<P>&gt; frying the eggs which
<BR>> Owl was hoping to raise as presidential candidates, etc.
<P>now, i consider frying presidential candidates to be a premeditated action (in fact, i'm inspired to premeditate it some, myself).
<P>and his pursuit (with the bear) of the adam-bug bomb was clearly done with the intent of devouring said object. and while his involvement in the consumption of the team of ptarmigens was accidental in the sense that he did not intend to thus target the opposing team, he _did_ know he was eating something (or somebody...always a little hard to discern how the swamp-dwellers felt about that...)

<P>That's what I mean. These were accidental in that it was not intended or pre-meditated (missed the Adam-bug bomb story, so passing on that). Not to say that Albert in any way visibly objected (one funny panel, when Pogo gets a ladder and a candle to go down Albert's throat to seek the tadpole, Albert insists on a farewell handshake first).

<P>if involved owl attempting to make an a-bomb using some bugs of the family name 'adam'. actually, as i think of it, the bomb albert tried to eat was a b-bomb, made by putting a bee-hive into a shoebox (bees were substituted for adam-bugs after pogo rescued said bugs from being split) - which albert and bear considered must actually contain lunch. so one could say it was accidental, in that albert was not intending to eat bees - but he sure intended to eat _something_ - and the result of his insatiable appetite was humor.

<BR>> say that Albert in any way visibly objected (one funny panel, when Pogo

<P>....which prompted pogo to try another way to rescue the chile....
<P>i was always intersted in the swamp-dweller's curious relationship with fish - fishing was a frequent activity, but sometimes the fish were released (even with thanks) - and other times they ended up as guests of honor at a fish fry. (and in the early years, there was a very large catfish who appeared and prompted the fishermen to return their catch to the waters)
