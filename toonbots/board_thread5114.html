<strong>Laptop!</strong>
<P>Or, should I say: lack of laptop. The fan went out this week and was shortly followed by the power supply... It's still under warranty but I have to send it in for *gulp* about two weeks!
<P>Now is the time when I wish I'd implemented a better backup strategy, like, oh, ANY backup strategy. Fortunately my work is such that most of it happens on other machines anyway, but still.... Ugh.
<P>The benefit: I'm forced to learn to use the Linux desktop I installed as a firewall for the DSL line.

<strong>Re: Laptop!</strong>
<P>We have Linux. It doesn't hurt me much. I'm severely irritated by my inability to paste between an old program I used to use in windows, and the new stuff. The little man tells me it's got something to do with an emulator.
<P>But since you have no backup plan, you're now free to write comics nonstop, right? Cause weren't wolverines going to be NEXT? :)

<P>Sorry, the muse has been stubbornly silent regarding the toon. I did spend some time with graphical enhancement of soft porn from the fark.com boobies links.... Unlikely to interest the majority of you, I suppose, but I came up with some very nice images, sort of ... minimalist pornography. All, of course, on the laptop's hard drive at the moment.
<P>I've spent the entire day today upgrading to Fedora. Or rather, repeatedly *not* upgrading to Fedora, thanks to my faulty installation of RedHat 7.2 which was the original reason to need to upgrade to Fedora. It had failed to write the CDs cleanly. A fact which I naturally discovered only halfway through the installation process -- leaving me with *no* working machine talking to the Internet. Not a good position.
<P>So I managed to make a minimal installation of Fedora (luckily CD#1 was fine) and re-downloaded the second CD and burned it to a fresh CD, and now I'm at least back in graphical interface land, a great relief. And the whole process only took me about seven hours.
<P>I did think of a mildly amusing script idea for Toonbots the other day, so maybe there's hope. And (cross your fingers) I've got a lead on an actual full-time job, programming open-source software, on a fully telecommuting basis with a German company. Lead, as in, I'm one of five remaining contenders for the two positions they'll be filling in February. We had a nice interview on the phone last Tuesday and I expect to hear from them pretty soon, hopefully with good news. I'm *pretty sure* that if I didn't have this financial stress, and if I manage to suppress the political obsession, I might actually start to feel funny again.
<P>That would be a Good Thing.

<strong>Re: Laptop!</strong>
<P>i think fedora is what my brother just put on my mom's computer - it looked pretty fun. one of these days i'm going to put in a second harddrive with linux - but i need to keep windows, because i have too many things that need it (like quicken, which now finally has all my financial data, and my recipe collection)

<P>lack of financial stress is _always_ a Good Thing. and more likely to contribute to the whimsey of the toonbot muse. (poverty and political obsession can result in humor, but it tends to be the dark, cynical type.) anyway, i will hold good thoughts on your getting the job!

<P>Good luck with the job interview process! I've decided to start looking again, as it seems that the little man is killing himself working two jobs. Ahem.

<strong>Re: Laptop!</strong>
<P>&gt; Good luck with the job interview process!
<P>The job interview process is done. It's a matter now of not going stark raving bonkers waiting for them to make up their minds. The company is only five people and they're deciding on which two of five other people to hire; they don't really have time to talk about it (otherwise they wouldn't need to hire anybody) and they're all software wonks anyway, thus I'm thinking they'd rather just not have to deal with it at all. It's now been 11 days since the phone interview -- meaning I haven't been ruled out yet, to me a positive thing. Or so I keep telling myself. Sigh.

<strong>Re: Laptop!</strong>
<P>wow - so they're increasing their company by 40%? that _would_ be a hard decision to make. continued positive thoughts.

<P>That's exactly what I told them -- and their answer was pretty good: since they're the commercial part of a truly robust open-source project, they effectively have a much larger programming 'staff' than just the four full-time paid people. So they don't regard this as a 40% growth so much as a reallocation of resources. I think it's a healthy viewpoint.
<P>Continue those healthy thoughts. I need the work.
