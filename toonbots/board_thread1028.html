<strong>I've been lazy again...</strong>
<P>So my weak excuse is that I lost my largest account last week and was scrambling to put my client base back in order. Yeah. I know, money is really a lame excuse, but hey. There ya go. Those darned mortgage companies can be so insistent. Plus my <a href="/wftk.html">workflow toolkit</a> is taking up a lot of my thinking time. Getting very interesting.
<P>Anyway, again in lieu of a new Toonbots, I thought I'd waste my time and yours with a Paintbrush soliloquy, a variation on Case Yorke's last (and maybe last?) strip of Jan. 22:

<P>Well, I *kind* of answered it. I said &quot;Hmm...&quot;.
<P>Sure, I can do a guest strip or even a couple. Your bunch could get into a very *wrong* dimension, heh, heh, heh. And by that time, maybe I'll be able to draw the Jihad even.
<P>I'm not sure what I'll do about glych and glych being in the Jihad and the main cast.... That gives me a headache even thinking about it. Even though you're only an untitled Jihad camp follower, I know that in your heart of hearts, you're in the Jihad.

<P>I'm always home. I work at home. Or is that, &quot;I live at work?&quot; The boundaries melt and flow together.
<P>See, I direct the multinational activities of that shadowy conglomerate known as Vivtek from my secret subterranean basement -- I mean BASE, subterranean BASE, of course. Which happens to be under my otherwise unassuming Bloomington house. And has a 12&quot;x18&quot; southern exposure, I might add (it would be twice as large were it not for that dryer vent.)
<P>During the summer, the multinational activities of Vivtek are often directed from a secret headquarters in Budapest, again by that shadowy figure known only as Michael.
<P>MWUhahahahahahhahahaa!

<P>I've always wondered how such horrid (though funny) beatings of the English language occur. It seems like it wouldn't be too hard to find some random English-speaking person on the street to check the game dialouge. But I suppose that if they did that we could no longer move 'Zig'. For great justice.

<strong>A fairly serious explanation (also look up &quot;Z</strong>
<P>&gt; What the *heck* are you people talking about?!?!?
<P>Well, isn't confusing others keeping with the spirit of Toonbots and the PAFTWJ? (Or maybe not. You know, I've been thinking that, at some point, we probably need to establish a charter for the Jihad, delineating traditions and customs; outlining conditions for defenestration and situations where the wolverines might be used instaed, or in addition to defenestration; possibly detailing the jihad hierarchy and the duties of each member; and in general, explaining the true spirit and purpose of Toonbots, the Toon-O-Matic, and the Jihad to all the infidels, so they'll understand our cause before they're defenestrated. Besides, it just might be useful as propoganda. Or as evidence if any of us are ever faced with a sanity hearing. Hmmm... Well, I still think it's not that bad an idea.)
<P>Regarding the &quot;all your base are belong to us&quot; and other references, I've been finding them on several Spot and Space boards lately. I remember seeing an explanation on a Space board which I normally don't look at, and I've forgotten which one it was now. However, it was also explained in this thread over at Keenspot Central: http://www.keenspot.com/KeenBoard/Forum1/HTML/000359.html
<P>Apparently it all started with a bad English translation of a video game, and somehow its spreading across message boards for online comics, and possibly elsewhere.

<BR>> and somehow its spreading across message boards for online comics, and

<P>In my case it was the result of finding a flash music video based upon this open sequence. First, the &quot;All your base&quot; obsession, it's actually not all that new. There were several random images posted to the SomethingAwful forum some time ago that were modified to include &quot;All your base belong to us&quot; or various other phrases from that sequence. However, I can't say /how/ long ago, since aparently the people running the something awful forums don't think that the datestamp needs to have anything beyond time of day and day of month (idiots! That has to be the most horrid message board I've ever seen! Aparently the high moron concentration there also has rather short attention spans, so I guess that anything that's more than 30 days is irrelevant and doesn't need to be dated properly. )
<P>Anyways, for the original intro sequence, look here: http://blackhole.cs.uwec.edu/~buzaan/zerowing.gif
<P>For the movie, all the places posted on git.talk.flame seem to be gone, so here's my copy of it: http://gophernet.org/dat/allyourbase.swf
<P>It has throroughly infected the Georgia Tech newsgroups. The source there was someone posted a link in git.test since one of the original sources of the movie had a username &quot;dank&quot;, and one of our local net.celebrities has the same username, hence it was thought to be interesting. I have no idea how the original poster found it.
<P>As for the resurgance in comic related forums, I believe that the source is the Bad Boy of Computer of Science forums. That's all I know, since I'm feeling too lazy to research it further.
<P>You have no chance to survive make your time
