<strong>Fan art, reviews</strong>
<P>I've included some new stuff on the Toonbots site. It's linked off the front page -- one link is a PAFTWJ page with Emsworth's fan art (!) and Chris's hilarious BoxJam stalking story (the one with the wolverines). I'll add a list of titled Jihad members eventually. Except that that jerk BoxJam has a title so I'd have to list him, too.
<P>Also, I have a few toon reviews which I've decided to open up to the public.

<P>My gratitude to the meta-cartoonist knows few bounds! The jihad has its own official lore now. Very nice.

<P>The Pokey review was the most amusing, in my opinion.

<P>Ooh. A metareview.

<strong>Re: Reviews</strong>
<P>&gt; Ooh. A metareview.
<P>That remark struck me as a trifle too facetious, and lacking in depth.
<P>Just noticed the &quot;Absolute Tripe&quot; review. Only casually looked at it, several months ago, and haven't gone through the archives yet (it failed to grip, for some reason, though I'll probably try again at some point, when I next have time to go through comic archives.) Still, I find the &quot;Pogo&quot; comparison rather interesting, primarily because the alligator (whose name I've forgotten) seemed to me to bear a marked resemblance to Albert.

<P>HAHAHAHAHA! A meta-meta-metareview!
<P>&gt; Just noticed the &quot;Absolute Tripe&quot; review.
<P>Maybe it *is* just the resemblance of Crockit to Albert, but I really do kind of see a deeper resemblance between Pogo and Absolute Tripe. There's that same sense of completely insane animal people reacting to the normal human world around them, if you know what I mean. Churchy LaFemme was one of the most characteristically absurd .. um .. characters ever to grace the funny pages. And Pogo was sane, but loved these insane friends of his ... I don't know. It all just kind of fits for me.

<strong>Re: Reviews</strong>
<P>Upon reflection, I feel that my original remarks may have been poor;y worded, though the reasonig was sound.
<P>As I said, I've really only glanced at &quot;Absolute Tripe&quot; (had forgotten the URL, in fact.) I'll probably go through the archives one weekend (I usually take my time with adding new strips, though, especially as my current reading list is already too long, though not as long as others.)
<P>

<strong>Napoleon's Fan Art</strong>
<P>Well! I just took another look at the PAFTWJ page, and noticed that the High Chancellor of Defenestration has done her own Toonbots tribute. The sight of the dot in an advanced state of, erm, substance induced delirium was highly amusing, as was the bottom caption. Bot really needs to relax to keep itself from getting all bent out of shape like that.
<P>Wonderful work, Napoleon, puts my own efforts to shame.
