<strong>8/30/01(allegedly)</strong>
<P>Hmmm... Well... This was different (for Toonbots, at least)... Quite a few webcomic in-jokes and references. Well, the dot's characterization seemed a tad unusual, to say the least, in the last panel, definitely, but for the most part, was not inconsistent with the way the character has been developing. Another nice schizophrenic blurb, as well.

<strong>Re: 8/30/01(allegedly)</strong>
<P>I /liked/ it! I'm not smart enough to say why in flowing beautiful language full of concepts and stuff like Emsworth, though. I liked it, it made me laugh.
<P>I especially liked that Dot talked really small.

<strong>Re: 8/30/01(allegedly)</strong>
<P>&gt; Hmmm... Well... This was different (for Toonbots, at least)... Quite a few
<BR>> webcomic in-jokes and references. Well, the dot's characterization seemed
<BR>> a tad unusual, to say the least, in the last panel, definitely, but for
<BR>> the most part, was not inconsistent with the way the character has been
<BR>> developing. Another nice schizophrenic blurb, as well.
<P>As I said, I'm not sure where it came from, but it seemed to work for me (and for Jenn as well, apparently -- I'm not quite clear on *what* she snorted through her nose, though...)
<P>The in-reference thing, that has a clear origin -- Toonbots will be participating in the Framed!!! escape storyline, in another couple of weeks. Further deponent sayeth not, it's all a Bigg Seekret. So that's got me thinking of the whole Webcomic scene -- and as I said, too, _Jay and Silent Bob_ just hit me as a film version of a Webtoon. A lot of the same humor and injoke stuff was what made the movie so funny.
<P>What I *don't* like about today's episode is that up till now I've been careful to keep both Dot and Bot completely gender-neutral, even though privately I've considered Dot female. And now I've gone and tossed that out the window. Or Dot did, in a very real sense.
<P>This cartooning stuff is complicated.

<strong>sex and toonbot-icity</strong>
<P>&gt; What I *don't* like about today's episode is that up till now I've been
<BR>> careful to keep both Dot and Bot completely gender-neutral, even though
<BR>> privately I've considered Dot female. And now I've gone and tossed that
<BR>> out the window. Or Dot did, in a very real sense.
<P>a while back you asked for comments about whether people prefered more continuity or standalone strips, and i didn't comment because i figure that in the end an artist (especially a metacartoonist) functions best if he/she follows their inner muse; to force one into a particular path can be killing the goose that laid the golden egg. (in other words, michael, anarchy suits you - go with it).
<P>HOWEVER: i also thought that one weakness of continuity strips (and similar efforts like sitcoms) is that when plot ideas run out, they tend to fall back on romance (as in sex, love and/or lust - not the stuff of that other thread)(altho sometimes romance _is_ science fiction), and with the cast lineup as i understood it -- well, i just wasn't sure that was a place i really wanted to go. (i mean, lenin and mao? is the whole pickle crisp thing going to turn into a 'cute meet'?) now that i know dot is female, i'm pretty much sure i don't want to go there. (i mean really - she's so much smarter than they are)
<P>i have no problem continuing to see the bot as gender-neutral.
<P>(no idea why i am so talkative today - must be friday)

<P>Huzzah! A Toonbots cross-over! Congratulations, Mr. R!
<P>And I didn't mention it specifically, but what is mainly what made me wonder about Dot (as I keenly recall your correcting us in the past on that.) A slightly different punchline could have avoided that (perhaps simply wanting a breath of fresh air in the world of Framed, or a new muu-muu or something), but it was still pretty good, just felt a tad, well, weird, for Toonbots at least.

<P>Pairing of Toonbots with Framed!!! like breeding watermelon and banana... produce strange fruit.
