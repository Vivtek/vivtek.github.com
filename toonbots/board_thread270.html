<strong>10/17 Spoiler (Cameo!)</strong>
<P>Well, been a bit preoccupied lately, and probably won't be posting at all for awhile, but I'm thoroughly enjoying the current minimalist plot direction. Butch's cameo was quite unexpected, and frankly he might be just the one to deal with the current election mess. Really nice, trademark expression you've chosen. I've always felt that the worried, thoughtful expression Mr. Herold gives to his creation somehow makes Butch rather sympathetic, a lost soul attempting to find his way in the world. Perhaps by finally embracing the pure simplicity of the Toon-o-Matic and falling under the guidance of the wise and benevolent dot and bot, he may finally find true peace.
<P>Political commentary, a nice rhyme scheme, more of the great gopherine dot, and a cameo to boot! My, you just keep churning them out this week, don't you, Mr. Roberts?
<P>I look forward to what new heights Toonbots might achieve in the near future (though frankly, I'm quite content right now!) (By the way, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I'm one of the few who has yet to receive a title from the PAFTWJ. As the one to post the first Toonbots spoiler, would you mind terribly if I selected &quot;Spontaneous Spoiler Specialist&quot; as my title of choice?)
<P>Well, goodnight all (and my sympathies for the High Priest.)
<P>

<strong>Re: 10/17 Spoiler (Cameo!)</strong>
<P>&gt; Well, goodnight all (and my sympathies for the High Priest.)
<P>Thanks. I'll get over it. Though I will have to talk to my roommate on clarity of symbols when this is over. I'm really just assuming that tape over the peephole means &quot;Do not distrub&quot;. It could mean &quot;I went to bed at unholily early hour, and, though I can handle the 50 bajillion LED's, two fans, and three hard drives that my roommate keeps going all hours of the night, I can't handle that little stream of light coming in from the peephole&quot;. And I've ordered a new fan; the open case setup seems to working for now.
<P>Ok, enough of my troubles, back to Toonbots. That is indeed a wonderful choice of expresion for Butch, since he seems to be seeking advice from the wise Bot and Dot, but is a little embarassed to do so. It should also be interesting to see the direction that Michael takes the Toon-o-Matic, as well. Perhaps some day we could see a cartoon with a few characters defined as vectors doing cartoony things. Man, that could get complicated real quick.

<P>That's exactly where I want to go with it. And yeah. It gets complicated real quick. But if RenderMan can be written to do Toy Story, by God I can do this for &quot;mere&quot; 2D cartoons.
