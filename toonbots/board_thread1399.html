<P>Ah, I'd been hoping someone would say something, but was unable to think of anything worth posting. Also, as the anniversary of the Defenestration of Prague is just two days away, I think the anticipation has been too much for us. I know the wolverines are really quite keyed up about it.
<P>

<P>Okay. Did you ever see &quot;Popeye the Sailor with Betty Boop&quot;? Not only was it the first Popeye cartoon ever, but it was noteworthy in that it was the only cartoon where Mae Questel played BOTH her main voice roles: Betty Boop and Olive Oyl!
<P>Okay, I've never seen it either. I'll bet Emsworth might have, though...

<P>it was actually just called &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; and it introduced both his first words: &quot;Well blow me down&quot; and his trademark song. Yeah, yeah, I've seen it...

<P>I have, actually. It was recorded off of Cartoon Network, though, and I wasn't the one who recorded it (it was a recording tape labeled &quot;Cartoons&quot; I picked up for a dime at a Goodwill store.) Unfortunately, it was one of those later, rather badly colorized prints of the original 1933 short (an animated Betty Boop in flesh-tones doesn't look right to me.) Ah, well.
<P>Speaking of Popeye, Jack Mercer is listed in the 2000 edition of the Guiness Bok of Records (though, not I believe, the 2001 edition) for providing the voice of a crtoon character for the longest period of time (I believe one of his last portrayals of the sailor was in the brief animated opening to that live action &quot;Popeye&quot; film, and it was also the only time where Mercer received on-screen credit for the role of Popeye. [He was listed in the generic voice lists in the later television cartoons, but was not identified as Popeye.]
<P>While we're discussing animation, Maurice Noble passed away on May 18, at the age of 91. As I'm sure Pooga and probably some of the rest of you know, Maurice Noble was a veteran storyboard and layout artist, designer, and art director best known for his work with Chuck Jones, on such classic shorts as &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot; and &quot;What's Opera Doc,&quot; and many more at Warner Brothers, and later with Chuck at MGM, working on the Dr. Seuss specials &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; and &quot;Horton Here's a Who&quot; (and most of the later Seuss specials with DePatie-Freleng as well.) Earlu in his career, he also spent some time with Disney, serving as a character designer for the Pink Elephant sequence in &quot;Dumbo,&quot; amongst other things. Sigh.
<P>
