<strong>Name that Communist!</strong>
<P>I got the first two with no problems, but I had to look at the XML source to get Marx. Oh well, I guess I don't win anything.

<strong>Re: Name that Communist!</strong>
<P>Well, we already knew Mao, Lenin was obvious, and lately I've been studying poltical science, so I've been seeing a lot of Marx. It was one of the sillier, almost surreal Toonbots (not that that is much of a distinction, when I think about it.) It just struck me as sort of odd, particularly Mao (&quot;Hey Fred.&quot;) Chairman Mao's beginning to creep me out. But the &quot;Name that Communist!&quot; blurb was hilarious. You ought to try &quot;Name That 19th Century Novelist&quot; next time. Might be interesting as a sem-regular feature. &quot;Name That Obscure Character Actor!&quot; &quot;Name That Labor Union Activist!&quot; &quot;Name That Unsuccessful Presidential Candidate!&quot; (you could do a whole series on that one alone!)

<P>Well, you people are the ones crying around about how you want more frequent updates. When I does'em off the cuff, they turns out weirder. (But they scan better.)
<P>I think the Disembodied Head Era is drawing to a close.

<P>&gt; I think the Disembodied Head Era is drawing to a close.
<P>Aww! And you still haven't used Jack Benny! As I said, though, I might be able to get the head of Pat Buttram for you, if you need it.
<P>Btw, I really didn't mean to criticize with my earlier comments, but today just sort of, well... took me by surprise. Now I'm going to have nightmares about Chairman Mao's head chasing me while Lenin sits in a corner drinking vodka with Al Gore.

<strong>Re: Surrealism vs. Minimalism</strong>
<P>&gt; Aww!
<P>No, I think I've overworked this vehicle. I'm getting bored with it.
<P>&gt; Btw, I really didn't mean to criticize with my earlier comments,
<P>Please, criticize away. It's all fun.
<P>&gt; but today
<BR>> just sort of, well... took me by surprise.
<P>It kind of wrote itself. I think I may be channelling one or more dead Communists. I had a Ouija-board feeling while writing it...

<strong>Re: Surrealism vs. Minimalism</strong>
<P>Actually, we might be able to use that as a selling point.
<P>Toonbots: Now, for a limited time only, starring the disembodied heads of dead Communists!
<P>That might get someone's intention!
<P>Toonbots: Better Red than dead (or in some cases, both.)

<P>It's hard to tell when you're being serious, but just in case you really don't know: Monty Python's Flying Circus.
<P>I think if you stuff Chris *into* a window from outside, that would have to be fenestration, though. Heh. Nice neologism, Napoleon. Nifty. Nearly gnarly.

<strong>Fenestrate</strong>

<P>That's kind of odd. There is a word &quot;fenestrate&quot;, but it's an adjective refering to the quality of being fenestrated, which refers to something about open pores. No windows mentioned at all. Perhaps the PAFTWJ could petition Merriam-Webster to add the proper definition of &quot;fenestrate&quot; to the dictionary.

<P>That's OK, we forgive you. You're very young. Besides, we're all afraid of defenestration (except Lee, who is made entirely of VegeMellows.)

<P>What were we talking about?
