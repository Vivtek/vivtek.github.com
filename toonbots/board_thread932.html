<strong>Possible radical change in plans</strong>
<P>So if a well-heeled insurance company located on the French Riviera told you they were looking for somebody to manage their workflow/ERP NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM and you looked like you'd fit the bill... What Would BoxJam Do? (Besides taking out the garbage.)
<P>I'm thinking... I'm thinking...
<P>I'm thinking SHOW ME MY PLANE TICKET, DAMMIT! That's what I'm thinking. Holy crap this could be my ticket outta this place, and let Dubya do what he will!
<P>French Riviera. I kid you not. Right next to Nice and Cannes. Not right *on* the Med, just about TEN MILES BACK. And it's an insurance company. More money than God Himself.
<P>Hot diggety dog, I love the Internet. The Internet is my friend. I'm so happy Al invented it. I'm gonna have to send him a thank-you note. From the French Riviera, baby.
<P>I'm knocking on entire lumberyards here.
<P>Whew. Thanks. I can tell you guys anything. It'll probably come to nothing, but just the possibility....

<strong>Still possible</strong>
<P>&gt; Bon Dieu! Excellent news, Monsieur! Residing in the French Riviera should
<BR>> be quite pleasant, n'cest pas?
<P>Mais oui! So I emailed the guy back yesterday, said I had a couple of open-source codebases I maintain so I have to be free to continue with those, gave him some pretty incredible salary requirements (well, priced as my consulting fees), told him when I could move and so on.
<P>He didn't say no. HE DIDN'T SAY NO! He said he'd talk to the CEO about the money but that I should recall that working in France includes those juicy socialist benefits (like 100% health care coverage), and that we could start on a consulting basis fairly soon, then I could move there later....
<P>So...
<P>It's still a qualified yes. One thing I'm learning: if you don't need a job you have a lot greater chance of getting it.
<P>&gt; French Toonbots would certainly be interesting, though.
<P>It would be even more surreal than it is now! Wow!

<P>Yeah, I told'em my moving costs would be infinite. They didn't seem to believe me. I guess I'll have each of the monkeys push the next monkey an infinitesimal distance -- then they'll be in Europe in no time.

<P>No problem there, I'm more likely to understand Spanish than French. The phrase comes out as intended upon running it through Babelfish, but this probably means that it's horribly, horribly wrong. I know that I got the gender wrong on the article to &quot;point&quot; (should be &quot;un point&quot;, I think), and hopefully there aren't too many more spots that I could have messed up.
<P>As for Spanish, I still remember a little bit from those classes I took in high school, so I can run around yelling &quot;Esto no es un punto&quot; with no troubles at all.

<strong>Unfortunate Situation</strong>
<P>Tengo un dolor de la cabezo grande!!! Tengo triste!
<P>I received the results of the first Spanish test of my second semester. I did incredibly porrly, failed it even. Hopefully, if I can get a 98 on the remaining tests, I might be able to pull a low A, as I desperately need to salvage my scholarship (the only reason I can afford to go to college, at the moment.) And the exam should not have been that difficult for me, it was mostly carelessness.
<P>I probably should have stayed away entirely from online comics and message boards once school started, or controlled my time. Anyway, in view of this and other academic pressures, and increasing concerns from the old flesh and blood, I'm afraid I really need to take a temporary leave from the jiha, during the next couple weeks or so (when my mother sees this grade, though, she may forbid me from going online when at home for the rest of the semester, thouh I suppose I could still sneak time during my free period, as I'm doing now, and which was probably a part of the problem.) All my own fault, really. Sorry for going on lie this, but for awhile at least, someone else will have to provide the spoilers. I've certainly enjoyed the lively discussion here, though, and will certainly miss the rest of the jihad. Well, farewell to all, for now.

<strong>Re: Possible radical change in plans</strong>
<P>My wife is totally pumped about this, but we weren't sure what our daughter would think. So today, after school, she suddenly says, &quot;Let's move to Florida for a year!&quot; My wife and I just looked at each other and said, &quot;Hey, how about another place with a beach?&quot; Heh. She wasn't too hot on that at first. Seems her friend Chris just moved to Florida, so it's not so weird to do that. But then she heard you can take a train from France to Budapest (which, as I think I've explained, is a cross between Valhalla and the Promised Land), and that you can take a short boat ride to Africa, and that her friend Jenna really liked France last summer (that was cool -- they visited us in Budapest for five days before moving on through Europe), and that the school is in English but she could learn French... She's sold. I think we have a winner.
<P>Now if the guy would just email back.... Maybe his talk with the CEO didn't go as well as I'd hoped. Le sigh. That'd really get the Jihad riled.
<P>Nah, Napoleon's right. It *will* happen.
