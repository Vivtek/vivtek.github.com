<strong>More comments from the Jihad....</strong>
<P>gopher, expanding on his discussion of the blurb: &quot;I just have a certain set of mockings for avant-garde music descriptions, and you can't talk about minimalist music without the descrption of the stark core of reality .... rather than distract the reader with senseless cartooning details, he [Michael] simply leaves the reader with an impression that a cartoon has occured. where or when is still unclear... so, basically it all comes down to that I really hate that show where they just play whirring noises.&quot;
<P>And from Napoleon, when I told her the metacartyoonist had updated, twice!: &quot;...... You lie. Or this is an alternate universe. For surely such a thing cannot be true!&quot;

<P>Word.
<P>In the spirit of totally ignoring such outmoded concepts like threading, your description of drivers in Ponce reminds me of Atlanta, but without the rage. The abandonment of reason is still there, though. It doesn't help that every time you say &quot;Ponce&quot; I think of the local section of highway 78. Stupid explorer, getting stuff named after him. He should have been more considerate to future generations and been less famous.

<P>....well....if it helps, my careful reading of the flashman papers has me convinced that 'ponce' is in the nature of an opprobrious epitaph.
<P>which reminds me - i thought 'satori' was a sort of knife.

<BR>> convinced that 'ponce' is in the nature of an opprobrious epitaph.
<P>So the new judicial appointee on the tropical island (in the age of British colonialism, of course) was faced with a knotty problem. He had a man before him, accused of operating a den of iniquity, but he was unsure of the sentence. Fortunately, the old lord justice had not yet departed, so a message was sent to him: &quot;How much do you give a ponce?&quot; The reply came that evening: &quot;Never more than 2 and 6.&quot;
<P>[Loosely recalled; probably an old saw, but first encountered in John Mortimer's Rumpole books.]

<P>well, depending on where frances comes ashore, there is, indeed, a possibility of the metacartoonist could end up on one.
