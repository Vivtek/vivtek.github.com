<strong>Linux!</strong>
<P>Well, the demise of the laptop has forced me onto my wife's machine for a while, which for various historical reasons is running Linux on the desktop. I've never used Linux on the desktop before (although I've been running Linux servers for a while) and my initial experiences with RedHat 7.2 weren't terribly positive. It was OK, but just OK.
<P>As I mentioned earlier, though, I upgraded to Fedora Core 1 when I moved onto the machine, largely due to some funkiness which had cropped up -- probably a corrupt filesystem, but frankly it was easier to wipe and reinstall than to figure it out. So I did.
<P>Wow.
<P>Fedora Core running a GNOME desktop *rocks*. There are a couple of things I'm still getting used to, but running Unix on your desktop machine is sooooooo convenient if you know Unix to start with (which I do), and the late-model GNOME apps are really starting to firm up into some seriously usable software.
<P>Definite two thumbs up. I may rewrite the Toon-o-Matic, people. It's time to ditch Windows (pace Gopher, and Jenn's husband, who always thought running a Perl app under Windows borderline-psycho to start with). Then it can run on the server anyway, far cooler.
<P>The downside to using my wife's machine is, of course, I'm not in the basement, thus *not in my secret subterranean base*. OTOH my desk chair rolls really well on the hardwood floors up here, and this time of year I have to admit that functional heating facilities have a great deal of attraction. And it's neat to be in the middle of the family as they go about their activities, instead of just tracking said activities by the sound of footfalls above my head.
<P>I may just stay up here after the laptop gets back. Until the weather heats up, anyway. Then the basement is a lot more comfortable.

<P>don't know how i missed this...

<P>i think this is what my brother put on my mom's computer over christmas - it looked pretty nifty, but i didn't have much time to play with it.
<P>&gt; I may rewrite the Toon-o-Matic, people. oh dear....

<P>was that not the point? my whole world-view is running into difficulties, here...

<BR>> basement, thus *not in my secret subterranean base*.
<P>can you move the computer under the desk? or at least pile couch pillows over it? in any event, i always like to think that a secret subterranean base is something you can carry with you always, inside yourself. it's really sort of a worldview thing.
<P>&gt; And it's neat to be in the middle of the family as they go
<BR>> about their activities, instead of just tracking said activities by the
<BR>> sound of footfalls above my head.
<P>this mean, of course, that you will start to find out what some of those sounds actually _meant_.
<P>(hence the virtue of having a secret subterranean base in your head)
<P>
