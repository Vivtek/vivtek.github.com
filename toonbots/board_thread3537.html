<strong>Re: weekdays</strong>
<P>i've been trying to parse today's weekday. i see two verbs and two agents, but no case markings to suggest which go how with what... of course english doesn't go in for them much. in finnish one could have kittissa batti or batti kittissa indifferently, or kitti battissa or battissa kitti (do cats eat bats? do bats eat cats?), and the inessiivi (-ssa) tells you everything: `in'. but here -- who sat on whom? and why no bunny?
<P>(again with the nonintention to inflate? what is this?)

<strong>interesting tactic...</strong>
<P>this posting under multiple identities - i see you intend a two-pronged attack on the posting list (not that i care or would even notice or anything...) (just _watchit_)
<P>&gt; i've been trying to parse today's weekday. i see two verbs and two agents,
<BR>> but no case markings to suggest which go how with what... of course
<BR>> english doesn't go in for them much. in finnish one could have kittissa
<BR>> batti or batti kittissa indifferently, or kitti battissa or battissa kitti
<BR>> (do cats eat bats? do bats eat cats?), (where do i remember this from? - pogo?) and i strongly suspect that the cats (and even the bats) would not in fact view 'kittissa batti' and 'batti kittissa' indifferently - especially if that is the translation.
<P>&gt; and the inessiivi (-ssa) tells you
<BR>> everything: `in'. but here -- who sat on whom? and why no bunny?
<P>why is everyone speaking in tongues here? what with the hungarian and finnish and germain and who all knows what.....(and finnish isn't even on babelfish, which is just unfair)
<P>actually your problem is in misinterpreting the grammatical position of 'pat'; in this context it is actually an adverb, thusly: 'the cat sat pat on the bat' (SAT PAT (the) CAT (on the) BAT - you have to remember michael's knowledge of german to translate the word order properly) the only other alternative is rather unfortunate, as it involves moving the bat from the animate to the inanimate category: &quot;SAT, PAT (the) CAT (with a) BAT&quot; - which would be more the mafioso version.

<strong>Re: interesting tactic...</strong>
<P>&gt; (just _watchit_)
<P>Hey! I din't do nothing! An you can't prove it either! An if you bother me again I'm callin my Mom, an then you'll be sorry!
<P>&gt; (where do i remember this from? - pogo?)
<P>Try Gracie Slick: _If You Go Chasing Rabbits_ (remember what the dormouse said?)
<P>&gt; and i strongly suspect that the cats (and even the bats) would not in fact view 'kittissa batti' and 'batti kittissa' indifferently - especially if that is the translation.
<P>Well, I don't think the kitti would mind which order you said -- and the batti, being kittissa in either case, wouldn't have much to say about it...
<P>&gt; &quot;SAT, PAT (the) CAT (with a) BAT&quot; - which would be more the mafioso version.
<P>Huh. So that's where the bunny was hiding. Who'd of thought of a name like SAT?
<P>

<P>spinclad, spinclad. Searching for analytic meaning is just a red herring. SatBatPatCat is a Seuss quote, of course: it's at the end of Hop On Pop (one of my favorites).

<P>Well, sure. Since my education only got as far as One Fish Two Fish (red herring blue herring), though, I was left with an itchy lacuna in the hoop of the week. Even if the search for sense makes no sense it seems to sometimes leave some interesting detritus in its wake (well, i was interested, anyway)...

<strong>The most horrible nightmare!</strong>
<P>I dreamt that I returned to the site and . . . and . . . the elvis pickle joke was back, by itself again! *sob*
<P>A sign that Toonbots matters to me, or that I don't have enough things to dream about? You be the judge.

<P>anyone who has studied psychology, even if only in an undergraduate survey course, knows that dreams are never about what they _seem_ to be about - they are always code for something much deeper and darker. let's consult freud...let's see, pickle, aloneness, deceased rock idols......hmmmmm.......
<P>you know, many communities have a free psychiatric referral service -- have you checked the phonebook?

<P>Anyone who has studied *psychologists* knows that all dreams, whatever is involved in them, are about sex. I don't think I've ever heard a dream analysis that didn't involve sex. This tells you something about the way psychologists think, or at least the way they spend their free time.
<P>Besides which, my dreams have plots, recurring characters, and a fairly consistent setting. And when they have something to say (and they do) they usually come out and bloody well say it. In other words, I'm on good speaking terms with my subconscious. Or at least, I'm reasonably certain I am.

<strong>wow.....</strong>
<P>That's ... Patrick, I must say it's humbling to imagine that you really had a dream about Toonbots. This is possibly the most profound fan statement anyone has ever admitted to about my work.
<P>On the subject of dreams, though, and psychologists -- I have to agree with you. The few times I can recall my dreams, they tend towards fairly involved science fiction plot lines. Exccept for the naked-in-public ones -- interestingly, I've been less bothered by the latter category, ever since I noticed that while *I* notice that I'm naked or otherwise in an embarrassing situation, it seems that no-one around me notices. So I just ignore it.
<P>My theory is that there is a dream center in my brain trying to get me to forget I'm dreaming. However, this dream center is naturally the same part of my mind which comes up with my other wacky ideas, like, well, like Toonbots. And it's the same part that likes science fiction. But weirdly, it's also illiterate. I'm convinced of this because I once had a dream in which I nearly broke through into a lucid state (i.e. one in which the dreamer realizes that he/she is dreaming, sometimes gaining control over the dream world -- my dream center doesn't permit me this, probably because I'm arrogant enough already). In this dream, I was at a (former) workplace, except it was my dad's house, too, except there was no roof. But more saliently, I needed to make a phone call. When I picked up the phone, it had no numbers on it; my dream center hadn't ever noticed them, apparently. Anyway, realizing this inconsistency, I came close to realizing I was dreaming, so the dream center changed things around; I squinted a little, then realized the phone *did* have numbers. They were typeface, cast in metal, and not in order, but they were numbers. Slowly I realized that they still weren't right -- at which point I was plunged into a different dream. The dream center had given up hope of fooling me into believing it was a real phone.
<P>Similarly, once I realized I was dreaming, at which point I woke up. I got up, went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and floated up off the floor -- at which point I woke up again. For real, this time.
<P>My dream center is pretty canny. One of these years I'm going to beat it. I've read about that lucid state, and it sounds pretty damned cool.

<P>Wow. I just thought it would be fun to mention. It's nifty to think I made a profound statement.

<P>I get the exact same thing. It's weird, but it passess quickly.
<P>&gt; My theory is that there is a dream center in my brain trying to get me to
<BR>> forget I'm dreaming. However, this dream center is naturally the same part
<BR>> of my mind which comes up with my other wacky ideas, like, well, like

<BR>> realized that they still weren't right -- at which point I was plunged
<BR>> into a different dream. The dream center had given up hope of fooling me
<BR>> into believing it was a real phone.
<P>I usually wonder if I'm dreaming, while dreaming, and then start remembering things that happened &quot;earlier that day&quot; in the dream, which makes me think I'm not dreaming. Sometimes I realize I'm dreaming, but then forget moments later. A few times I've been in a lucid dreaming state, and it was usually quite cool. Though oddly enough, it took greater effort for me to fly or alter the dream while lucid than it did during normal dreams.
<P>As an odd aside, nearly all of my dreams take place in the third person. I mean, I'm still myself, and I know what I'm thinking, but I see myself as though I'm looknig through some mobile comera, often from above. Odd, eh?
<P>&gt; Similarly, once I realized I was dreaming, at which point I woke up. I got
<BR>> up, went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and floated up off the
<BR>> floor -- at which point I woke up again. For real, this time.
<P>I think my record is waking up four times before actually waking up. Each time I would roll out of bed, turn off the alarm and then wonder why it kept making noise. Those last two times my dream was just messing with me.

<P>well, i _did_ say i was consulting freud. then again, sometimes a pickle is only a pickle.....

<P>well, that depresses me....mine are rather amorphous, and sometimes i'm not even in them. (no, i really don't want to know what that says about my relationship with my subconcious.....i try to take suggestions in the spirit in which they are given, i don't remember really overreacting to something my subconcious told me - i thought we were _friends_, at least, and i try not to be pushy, or anything - i mean, really, whatever my subconcious wants to do is fine with me, really, it doesn't need to _account_ to me or anything, you know - i'd just like to keep in touch occasionally. if you run into my subconcious, tell it to give me a ring - i'm sure we can work this all out.)
