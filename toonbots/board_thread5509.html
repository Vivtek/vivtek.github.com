<strong><a href="mailto:blandings5@despammed.com">Emsworth the Artistic</a></strong> <i>Sat Nov 20 17:51:20 2004</i><br>
<strong>Dances With Wolverines</strong>
<P>Still busy with grad school applications, though finally finishing up the entries for Jerry Beck's animated features book, due out some time next Fall in all likelihood. Still need to get Jenn's goodies together, and Michael needs to check his e-mail and get back to me on the Wodehouse titles.
<P>In the meantime, the artistic muse has returned to me, and in honor of the time of the year, and celebrating their noble heritage, I shall be presenting to ye all who post with forked tongues images of the glorious wolverine, the so-called Devil of the North, in traditional Native American attire. (Besides, the horde got into my cache of John Ford movies, and have thus currently absorbed a passion for the West and for ancestral customs, in more ways than one, which only makes me glad that these were used VHS, and that DVDs are slightly tougher on the teeth, only in that they twist around and get stuck to the roof of their mouths, as Godfrey learned when he graciously volunteered to rid me of the HR Pufnstuf boxed set).
<P>In any event, behold, in native splendlour, Alaric, demonstrating his manhood, bravery, and ability to look adorable in feathers.

<P>not to be picky or anything - but shouldn't that be 'wolverinehood'?
<P>but he does look pretty cute in feathers. and i _love_ the moccasins.
<P>(and speaking of wodehouse...weren't you throwing around offers of the book you're in, accompanies by wodehouse? i've decided not to worry about what i might already have - it's been long enough since i read them that anything will seem new. although maybe if you have something not of the wooster/jeeves canon...anyway, let me know)

<P>It depends on whether Michael ever gets back to me, and if he decides to hog the whole lot when he does. I'll keep you posted, though. If by any chance you lack the immortal &quot;Code of the Woosters,&quot; the store has two copies.

<P>Oh, you're in for a treat. It's a classic entry in the saga, continuing the romance of Gussie Fink-Nottle and Madeline Bassett, and introducing the unforgettable Roderick Spode, leader of the Fascist organization the Black Shorts (since by then, all of the shirts were taken). Did you want it by itself, or did you want Animation Art to? I ask because a) it would take longer if the latter as I'd need to order the book, and b) you'd need to pay me in advance.
<P>At this point, probably be easier for me to just send you C of the W, perhaps with the flap adorned by a monocled wolverine.
