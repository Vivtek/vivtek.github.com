<strong>A panoply of semiotic allusive constructs</strong>
<P>I slaved over that turn of phrase, I can tell you!
<P>Seven dailies in a row! You people never had it so good! This is, by the bye, the 74th episode of Toonbots. Amazing that it got into the double digits in the first place, but at this rate, I could be looking at strip 100 by late September, assuming the daily pace is sustainable.
<P>Weird, I tell you. Weird.

<P>He's a fiend, he is. Just like last time when he updated four times in a row, or so. It makes the lengthy gaps all the more difficult.
<P>::wolverines growl ominously in Michael's direction::
<P>Ignoring this possible slight streak of sadism for the nonce, though, a very amusing instalemnt today. I've always enjoyed those Toonbots which have been in verse (you're not familiar with some of Norman Corwin's verse radio plays, are you, Michael?) And indeed, the blurbs have been especially notable of late. So capital job, o possibly fiendish meta-cartoonist.
<P>

<BR>> very amusing instalemnt today.
<P>Thank you! No, Napoleon, it's not sadism, just getting too busy. Although I admit that it does provide me with a modicum of amusement thinking about all the weeping Jihad members... Seriously, when I finish an episode, I grin ear to ear and think, &quot;They're going to *love* this.&quot; Then a couple of hours later, I think, &quot;This one was really stupid.&quot; And then weeks later when I reread the archives, which I do sometimes, I think, &quot;This stuff is just plain weird. What moron writes this tripe, anyway?&quot; See, I've sufficiently dissociated my ego from it by then.
<P>&gt; I've always enjoyed those Toonbots which
<BR>> have been in verse (you're not familiar with some of Norman Corwin's verse
<BR>> radio plays, are you, Michael?)
<P>Sigh. No, as you've doubtless by now recognized, my education in anything pre-1980 is deficient to an extreme. All I know I've learned from science fiction. Granted, there's a lot you can learn from science fiction -- but there's a lot you can't. I have tried to read literature, with some success, but that tremendous gap comprising the greater part of the Twentieth Century is empty.
<P>&gt; And indeed, the blurbs have been
<BR>> especially notable of late.
<P>Thanks. I honestly don't know whether I can keep it up. But &quot;semiotic allusive contructs,&quot; now that was inspired.

<P>You HAVE been reading too much sci-fi, haven't you? &quot;Semiotic allusive construct&quot; sounds kind of like sci-fi-speak for a mobile home.

<P>No, not sci-fi -- cognitive science. Far weirder.

<P>Unfortunately, that was a quote, from _Hudson Hawk_. It's harder to come up with original nonsense than is immediately apparent to the uninitiated.

<P>If you like Toonbots, there's a good chance you'll like Hudson Hawk (Bruce Willis movie). Go rent it.

<P>You must be younger than I am -- Bruce Willis started out on TV in &quot;Moonlighting,&quot; which was a comedy and in which he played a tough-guy kind of character. I didn't see it much (I was out of the country during that time) but I did love the episode or two I saw later.
<P>_Hudson Hawk_ was (I think) his first movie, and he played essentially the same character. It's basically an action cartoon shot live-action. Plus some of it was filmed in Budapest. So it's gotta be good, right?

<P>According to IMDB, he had an uncredited role in the film _The First Deadly Sin_ back in 1980, even before Moonlighting (which apparently began around 1985.) Haven't seen _Hudson Hawk_ yet, but I'll keep it in mind. I did like his acting in _Nobody's Fool_ (the 1994 film of that name), though- wonderful job and not at all typecast. I say this, btw, as someone who readily admits that his movie knowledge and experience could... use work.

<strong>Re: Hudson Hawk</strong>
<P>you are so sweet to take my reticence for youth! actually i am old enough to remember Moonlighting -- which was very good in the beginning but sorta went downhill the last year -- which may have been one of the things that kinda disinclined me to watch Bruce Willis (unfair, but there you are)

<P>Further on the same subject, _Hudson Hawk_ wasn't until 1991, while his appearances in _Blind Date_ (1987) and the first _Die Hard_ movie (which I also haven't seen) (1988) predate that (at least according to IMDB, which relies on its contributors and is as fallible as, well, anything else.) (He had another uncredited movie appearance, in The Verdict, before Moonlighting started in 1985, according to the same source btw...)
<P>I have no illusions as to the importance of this very minor point. And anyway I have a webpage about which I still get the occasional email, which I _cannot_ edit anymore for various reasons, entirely devoted to the music of a 20th-century composer. I got his birthdate and deathdate completely wrong. (I had someone else in mind when I typed them, but didn't notice until, years later, it was pointed out to me.) A bit embarrassing as there are enough people, more in England than here, but still enough, who know the right dates...

<P>Oh, yeah. Blind Date. I'd forgotten that one -- it was funny but just didn't have the archetypical impact on me that Hudson Hawk did. Die Hard, now -- I'm just surprised that predates Hudson Hawk. Go figger.
