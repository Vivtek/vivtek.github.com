<strong>Oddball Update #3: Trout!</strong>
<P>http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/oddball/index.cgi?date=2001-12-03
<P>This week, the inimitable Oddball Comics is focusing on fish, and decided to start things off with this classic cover (which I'm also fortunate to have in a trading card set.)
<P>Though it's been awhile since this phrase has been utterred in the strip, I thought it might prove pleasant and instructive, what, what? If possible, try to follow the rest of this week's fishy Oddballs as well (which so far have also included Super Mer-Man and a rather large crab.)

<strong>Trout!</strong>
<P>Hrm. While I know I appreciate it a great deal, one would think that with one week left of school and presumably exams looming, that Emsy would have other things to do than find me stuff to giggle over at work. Not that I'm complaining. Just worried about his welfare.
<P>And it's just heartwarming to see how the old classics keep turning back up in the arts, over and over. I see now where my favorite episode of Scooby Doo got it's inspiration. You know, the one where Fred thwarts the evil property owner who's dressed up as the ghost of Pokey by whipping a trout at him? And the owner says, &quot;I'd have done it, too, if it weren't for these meddling kids. And their trout.&quot; and everyone laughs and Shaggy gives the trout a Scooby snack?
<P>I heard (and this is from an unofficial source, so take with a grain of salt) that that's where Scooby's insecurity problems started, competing with the trout for screen time. And that's what started him on that downward spiral of drugs, catnip, and that disasterously dysfunctional relationship with Benji.
<P>I know that Michael's probably gonna yell at me for changing my mind again, but could I have that title having to do with being all evil (cause I'm /not/! Someone /else/ called me that! I'm sweet and good!) changed to 'Smartly Trimmed with Richly Grained Leatherette'?
<P>Cause that's way cooler.

<P>You know, I discovered the 'previous' link cunningly hidden beneath the distracting brightly colored covers on that web page and now I'm all hooked.
<P>I wish I was a mermaid. Then I could swim without getting my wash and set hairdo soggy. I especially like the smart suit top with the little ruffle so we don't see where her human half connects to her fish half. And the pearls. I think it's likely that merpeople would closely follow the fashion trends of the land borne. After all, it might not be under water, but it's still Paris.

<strong>The Benefits of Michael's Forum</strong>
<P>You know what the very very very best thing about this particular forum is?
<P>(aside from just adding posts in a never ending line of answering myself that really looks quite pathetic. Geez. Someone make me look better and put something in between there, huh?)
<P>The personal and immediate attention. Look! I got a new title! And I think it describes me /way/ better than that silly evil one. Richly grained. That's /so/ me! Thanks, Michael!
