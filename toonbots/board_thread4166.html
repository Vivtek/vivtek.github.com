<strong>Re: all your base are belong to us..</strong>
<P>no, no, no... I hang out on a message board, where there is a nut case who posts only in german, he has been sending the &quot;all your base&quot; thing to me, when I translate his posts it never made sense, I asked about it, he wouldnt elaborate. Said he could give me no info on that quote. So, I did a search and found the article Michael posted with the translations. I decided to ask what it meant...

<P>We want URLs to said message board!
<P>For the record, Michael *is* into head games (as witness all of Toonbots) but not with complete strangers. (mouse, for shame.) And &quot;all your base&quot; (or &quot;AYBABTU&quot; as fondly dubbed during its heyday, from Feb. 10 - 21, 2001) was really big for a very short time. It's what I'd like to think of as an &quot;Internet fad&quot; -- literally over before most people noticed it had started.

<P>Well, I really dont think you would be interested in the board, its kind of a goof (not at all like this). Anyway, sorry to bug you guys here, but thanks for explaining the quote. I must say it doesnt help me in my quest for answers though.

<P>no problem - but i must say, someone who keeps posting aybabtu (auf deutsch, yet) probably hasn't even got a good hold on a _question_ - so your search for answers is likely to be fruitless.

<P>&gt;Yepper, quiet is the word for this place (and before you all think &quot;what a queer, yepper?&quot;) I am a woman. As to whether the nutcase has a question...the &quot;all your base&quot; thing is but one of many quotes he uses, he also does Shakespeare, Byron, and Doyle...Go figure.

<P>Otu's not very good with gender classification at times.
<P>&quot;Yepper&quot; is queer? Dang. I think I need to re-evaluate my sexuality.
<P>surfer, I'm getting some serious heartland-Midwest vibes from you. Not the Dakotas, I'm thinking somewhere between Ohio and Iowa or Kansas. How accurate am I?

<P>Well, he's still in his infancy, after all. We don't expect him to do much more than be cute and fall asleep in people's laps without shedding too much.

<P>oh yes - you definitely don't want them to do it _un_amiably. (they are wolverines, after all)

<P>Witness! Tell it, brotho!
<P>&gt; but not with complete strangers. (mouse, for shame.)
<P>but -- but -- how would new jihadis find their way here, if as complete strangers they never had a chance to experience the Toons, and the Archives, and the Forum, and in the end learn to submit the direction of their former lives to this great immersive calling? it just doesn't make sen//
<P>sorry (bad habits die hard). never mind.
<P>&gt; And &quot;all your

<P>A flash, a burst, a boom, and a nice long fading tail (thanks respectively to photons, muon showers :) , electron exclusion pressure, and residual excitement... extra points for classification by spin), suitable for patriotic display.

<P>hey - 'a nutcase who posts only in german' - you can see where i might leap to conclusions.
<P>but you're right - if i had thought it through, i would have realized that you would probably post in hungarian, as well.....
