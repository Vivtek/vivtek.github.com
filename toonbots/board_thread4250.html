<strong>Princess Mononoke - roughly 12.5</strong>
<P>My God. The culmination of the very notion of film. No wonder I hear so much about this movie. From the loving detail of the artwork to the equally loving detail of the world created by the writers, to the exquisite *reality* of the characters and towns and life seen in passing -- just ... perfect. And for once, the voice talent wasn't made up of temps hired from Manpower for the day.
<P>If, by some odd chance, you have neglected to see this movie, and any video store in your tristate area has an anime section, rent this. You won't regret it.

<P>And Neil Gaiman made some lovely english to hear it in. (As a fan of his I'm so glad this pulled me in, to appreciate all its _other_ qualities of wonder.)
<P>Oh -- and that was one BIG wolverine that it was all about, too! covering the countryside with ash and everything. Rating here: 13 out of 10.

<P>Huh. But it was just so big and warm and natural to the place and _important_. You mean, it wasn't?

<P>the ashes reference should have tipped me off. and by the time i get around to renting it, it will only be available on dvd, which i don't have - so guess we're even.

<P>though elk gods don't usually go around covering the landscape with ash either. it were unusual circumstances, arrrh.

<P>if you can, i think you would enjoy it much (or would that be it would enjoy you much -- it would light much joy in you). but as you can and will.

<P>Don't see why. Not every video store has it, of course, in either format, but considering how one can still find stores that have copies of films which last saw the light of VHS around 1986 or so... The Hollywood Video near my house has it on video, not on DVD, and they're selling a used copy for about 7.99. I've thought about it. I was quite impressed with it the first time I saw it, but I'm not sure how frequently I'd rewatch it, except for the end credits. If I ever do, though, send me an e-mail with your address and one of these days I'll lend the tape to you. Right now I need to finish copying a tape containing a charming stop-motion puppet short &quot;The Magic Treasure&quot; and other clips and documentary footage of the late stop-motion artist David Allen.
<P>No idea when or if Myazaki's latest film, &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; will reach El Paso, or even the Mesilla Valley.

<P>that's so kind of you! i suspect the video stores around here do have it - it's just i never seem to have enough time (or am not sufficiently organized) to actually manage to a) rent a movie and then b)watch it. this is also the reason i see so few films in the theaters - by the time i realize i have time to go to a movie, i'm at home, and without any enthusiasm to go out again. for example, for about the last month, i've been getting home, turning on the tube, then realizing that there is absolutely nothing on - and now that i've figured that out, next week all the season premiers start - so i'll be checking those out. i have at least started keeping a list of movies i want to see - so at least if i do manage to cruise by the video store, at least i'll know what i want to look for. (actually i should check the library - they have quite a few videos - and I _do_ go by there regularly)
