<strong>Stupid Muse</strong>
<P>The damned Muse started a completely different prose fiction story this week. I'm up to 12000 words and can't stop. I want to see how it comes out.
<P>This one might be more publishable. Maybe. It's modeled uncomfortably close on my actual life, at least until the first time travel incident on the second page, and I'm not sure it would be possible to change the names to protect the innocent (I mean, my wife is Hungarian. I could change her name. Would it be less obvious? No.)

<strong>Re: Stupid Muse</strong>
<P>&gt; I'm up to 12000 words and can't stop.
<P>For the sake of comparison, that's one-twelfth of Charlie Stross's _Accelerando_. Does that technically mean that I could write a novel in two months? That doesn't seem right. I think the Muse would fail me at some point.

<P>my word - it certainly seems a persistant sort of thing.
<P>i would suggest you do that national writer's month thing, except given the somewhat cantankerous nature of your muse, that would probably guarantee you would have writer's block for the month.

<strong>Re: Stupid Muse</strong>

<P>Well, after Hungary becomes a nuclear power in 1993 on our second run through history, I think you're right, people probably aren't going to tie it to my life. Only -- for verisimilitude, a *lot* of people and places and incidents in the story are exactly as I experienced them. It would be autobiographical if it weren't for the, you know, time travel, alternate timelines, and gender changes.
<P>Sort of defies categorization.
<P>The alternate histories are fun, though: Bill Gates funds Linus Torvalds directly, so that Windows 94 turns out to be based on the Linus kernel and is open-sourced on release. The RIAA supports file-sharing and micropayments by 1992.
<P>&gt; also, i suspect once people hit the first time travel incident, they will
<BR>> pretty much stop trying to tie it to your actual life.
<P>It's not people-in-general I worry about. I don't mind you people knowing my sexual preferences, for instance. Given the fact that I'm recycling my wife as a major character, though, it's not really something I'm entirely confident about releasing to the public.
<P>&gt; ....unless you actually _have_ been time traveling AND HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
<BR>> THE COURTESY TO COME BACK IN TIME AND GIVE US NEW 'TOONS!
<P>Yes, well, take a number. The next number is 37,823 and the Muse Complaint Department is currently servicing customer #2.
<P>&gt; in which case, we will scrutinize every syllable, and make sure we are in
<BR>> place to stalk you throughout time and ruin your life forever.
<P>Hell, you already are. That's what worries me.

<P>a celebration that can be taken many ways, but in typical toonbot fashion, it does deserve to be celebrated. and also the hungarian time travel thingy.
<P>by the way - do you suppose it will have wolverines? as a sort of homage to you previous creative endeavors.

<P>If I know Michael, and I'm often not sure I do, a lack of wolverines would be intentional, to spite us, as is his way. In fact, he may well have flagrantly brought attention to the complete and utter absence of wolverines, and possibly penguins, butterflies, and mice as well. But not dead Communists, I'd wager. That would be taking things too far, and besides, what's the good of a time travel event if you can't meet dead Communists, or at least dead hatchet-wielding prohibitionists? Ah, Carrie Elizabeth Nation.

<P>On that point, by the way. I don't know anything about Czechoslovakia or Romania or Austria. Not at the level I know about Hungary, Germany, and the Caribbean, for instance, all places I have actually lived.
<P>I'm pretty sure that as much as I like story #2, both of these are going to have to be considered practice runs.
<P>But I really, really like this second story. At least -- I like the first alternate timeline. The second just started, and I'm not at all sure it's going to stay the way it is right now. It's much weaker at the moment, I fear.
