<strong>USA well on track to third-world status</strong>
<P>Thank you, George Bush.
<P>Tens of thousands of refugees are now walking out of a New Orleans which will apparently be uninhabited for months while they attempt to drain it. Why were they not evacuated? Why were the levees left unfinished?
<P>Two reasons: the money was needed in Iraq and for tax cuts for the wealthy, and FEMA has been redefined by the Bush administration as an agency which is run by their buddies and vaguely supports anti-terrorism efforts.
<P>In the event of any real terrorist attack, of course, an evacuation would be necessary. Yet the federal government appears to have expended literally *zero* effort in building such a system, if New Orleans is any indication.
<P>Now, we have walking, starving, honest-to-God refugees in Louisiana. The U of Louisiana in Baton Rouge has barred its doors to protect its students and staff while the *refugees* walk past. No joke.
<P>Where is the National Guard? In Iraq, getting killed due to lack of war preparation. Hey, good planning there!
<P>Where is *anything* the Bush administration said it would do? Absent. They can't even drop any drinking water into New Orleans. They just don't give a shit.
<P>Send some money to the Red Cross. They've already raised $21 million dollars, but it will be a drop in the bucket. Remember the tsunami in Asia? The storm surge from Katrina was HIGHER, reaching as far as SIX MILES inland in Mississippi and Georgia.
<P>People are dying -- starving -- in the United States of America, because our government thought it was more important to enrich the wealthy and the oil corporations. Even a banana republic can do better than that.
<P>Remember -- this month it's New Orleans. But Bush and his gang don't care about *your* neighborhood, either.
<P>Impeach the bastard before you're next. But first -- donate to the Red Cross, because your country needs it, badly.

<strong>Re: USA well on track to third-world status</strong>
<P>did that this morning.
<P>blank label comics is having a webcomic telethon (starting 12 sept) to raise money - www.webcomictelethon.com - figure that will make a good opportunity to donate more.
<P>i keep hoping things that happen will wake people up to what this man really is - a man who couldn't take time out of his vacation to talk to a bereaved mother camped outside his ranch - and now, someone makes a pass over new orleans in air force one and figures he understands what this is all about.
<P>the problem is, of course, that we would have to impeach the whole administration.....

<P>&gt; Send some money to the Red Cross. They've already raised $21 million
<BR>> dollars, but it will be a drop in the bucket. Remember the tsunami in
<BR>> Asia? The storm surge from Katrina was HIGHER, reaching as far as SIX
<BR>> MILES inland in Mississippi and Georgia.
<P>Not to pick nits about catastrophe, or anything (though I am), but are you sure that Georgia is the right state? We don't tend to get hit by hurricanes, since we have Florida on one side and the gulf stream on the other, sending errant hurricanes convienently on to South Carolina more often than not. Georgia floods because we haven't figured out how to build drainage systems.
<P>I think maybe you meant Alabama. Mobile got messed up a bit. Home rule and all that.

<BR>> all that.
<P>I sit corrected. I've driven through both states a number of times and still manage to get them utterly confused. Georgia = Coca Cola. Alabama = NASA.
<P>It's terrible what happened to Biloxi, Florida, though. And New Orleans, Arizona will never be the same.

<strong>Re: USA well on track to third-world status</strong>
<P>I need to post a couple of corrections here.
<P>&gt; Tens of thousands of refugees are now walking out of a New Orleans which
<BR>> will apparently be uninhabited for months while they attempt to drain it.
<P>Correction: local law enforcement is not allowing people to walk out. They are turned back at gunpoint because they are considered too dangerous.
<P>&gt; Send some money to the Red Cross.
<P>By all means, send that money to the Red Cross -- but know that FEMA is not allowing the Red Cross into New Orleans. They say that if they help people there, they won't be motivated to evacuate. Never mind that FEMA's pathetic half-hearted too-late effort makes it impossible for people to leave, and if they attempt to walk out they'll be shot -- in the meantime, they have no food or water because FEMA doesn't want to pamper them.
<P>In any rational world, our entire federal response system would be tried for multiple counts of murder, because that's what this is: genocide. The United States has now joined the ranks of such enlightened states as Rwanda.
<P>We're back in Puerto Rico, by the way, and so we have access to American cable television. The pravda outlets like CNN are doing a bang-up job selling the relief &quot;effort&quot;. I had really thought that the Bush administration was incapable of disgusting me more.
<P>I was wrong.
<P>&gt; Remember -- this month it's New Orleans. But Bush and his gang don't care
<BR>> about *your* neighborhood, either.
<P>This part needs no correction. By the way, think hard about four words: New Orleans, and eminent domain. Care to take any guesses how many of the poor of New Orleans will ever return to the property they currently own? I'm guessing zero.
<P>&gt; Impeach the bastard before you're next.
<P>I stand by this one, too. Think Mussolini. (The difference being that Bush can't even make the trains run on time.)
<P>
