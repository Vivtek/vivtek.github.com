<P>by coincidence today's (as it were) li'l abner has an important political point - still valid after all these years...

<P>yeah, there was a fair amount of that here. both the major candidates for governor spent most of their commercial time telling us what an utter criminal the other guy is. (actually i guess the incumbent did list some of the things he _has_ done - but i don't recall that anyone had ideas about what to do about the deficit.)

<P>WE ARE HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE RECENT FAILURE TO VOTE FOR THE UNITED ARMED PENGUIN FRONT WHICH, WHILE IT DOES NOT EXIST AND ONLY RAN A SINGLE CANDIDATE, FOR COUNTY COMMISSIONER IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO, IS STILL ENTITLED TO THE BASIC DEMOCRATIC RIGHT OF SWEEPING ALL ELECTIONS AND CONQUERING THE NATION IN A BLOODLESS COUP.
<P>THE NAMES OF ALL REGISTERED AND UNREGISTERED U.S. VOTERS WHO FAILED TO VOTE PENGUIN ARE BEING RECORDED IN OUR BOOKS WITH GREEN FROWNY FACES BESIDE THEM.

<P>_where_ is your initiative? a _real_ political party doesn't let a little thing like mere absence of votes prevent them from declaring a coup (or a &quot;mandate&quot;, to be p.c.)

<P>Either you live in California, or all gubernatorial races are now run like that. Actually, I would imagine the latter is true anyway.

<P>Another, from Harry Truman via some blog somewhere, is &quot;If you give the American public a choice between a Republican and a Republican, they'll pick the Republican every time.&quot;
<P>Testify, Brother Harry.
