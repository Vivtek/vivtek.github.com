<strong>Question for Michael</strong>
<P>(This has nothing whatsoever to Toonbots, but you're the resident Hungary expert so it's natural to ask...)
<P>In the past couple weeks, I've had people reach my page through searches on the string &quot;Horrol&quot; which of course is the last name of my main characters. I checked Google on that myself and found that two hits out of the five were Hungarian-language sites. Is this an actual word with some meaning that I didn't know? (I had thought it was a meaningless nonword when I decided to use it.)

<strong>Re: Question for Michael</strong>

<BR>> some meaning that I didn't know?
<P>Well, just because it means something in Hungarian doesn't mean it's not a meaningless nonword in English. I would wager that it's impossible to come up with a two-syllable concatenation of phonemes that isn't a perfectly good word in one of the gazillions of languages on the planet. I mean, you wouldn't expect to know the words &quot;bizzunk benne&quot; or &quot;szerencsejatek&quot; either, right?
<P>I don't know the word, but phonetically it looks perfectly Hungarian; I'll ask my wife.

<strong>Re: Question for Michael</strong>
<P>On another moon-man language tangent...
<P>A relative was looking for a language training program for Hungarian. I tried all the obvious places, found lots of language software, but not for Hungarian. Has anyone come across any such thing? PV

<P>I've found the most effective way to learn Hungarian is to marry a Hungarian, have a child, and attempt to teach the child Hungarian. It's a never-ceasing source of amusement for the entire nation of Hungary plus you may end up knowing words like &quot;potty&quot;, &quot;diaper&quot;, and &quot;eat.&quot;
<P>Seriously, though, the best Hungarian text I ever saw was published by the US State Department as part of their language training programs. I'm not sure how you'd track it down, but your public library should be able to help. If you're in a major city, in fact, your public library may have it.
<P>The State Department language texts are far superior to Berlitz anyway, as they're used to train diplomats and spies instead of tourists.
