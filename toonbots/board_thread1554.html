<strong>Meta-fanart (Emsworth)</strong>
<P>All this talk about meta-cartoonists leads me to believe that Toonbots requires a special kind of fanart--in fact, it requires meta-fanart.
<P>To this end, I have created a VRML specification for Emsworth (mostly because he got me involved in this, so he deserves it).
<P>It's at http://www.nightstar.net/timberbram/toonbots/Emsworth.wrl<br>
<embed SRC="http://www.nightstar.net/timberbram/toonbots/Emsworth.wrl" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=200>
<P>A VRML plugin for your browser is needed to see any graphics.
<P>If you prefer not to undertake the effort, I've created a group of Emsworth images using screenshots of the VRML for your viewing pleasure at http://www.nightstar.net/timberbram/toonbots/emsworth-fanart.png<br>
<img src="http://www.nightstar.net/timberbram/toonbots/emsworth-fanart.png">
<P>Michael, please make the URIs into active links (or grab copies of the meta-fanart for your site (if you want) and link to your local copies).

<P>Peace, Tim Bram &lt;-- working on living up to his title of Knight-Artificer of Pixels.

<P>Gosh! That's quite an impressive piece of work! I'm flattered, Tim! I'd never even heard of VRML, but it's pretty nifty. Many thanks!

<P>You're welcome, Emsworth. I hope you didn't mind the monocled version instead of the pince-nez. Since we were discussing Jihad personalities I thought that would be the correct version, given the sketch that Michael did of you.
<P>I'm trying to decide who to do next: Napoleon or gopher. (Yes, I'll ...ahem... borrow liberally from the posted sketches again. Meta or not, it's still fanart and therefore must depend on the material the cartoonist (or meta-cartoonist) provides.)
<P>Peace, Tim Bram.

<P>That's fine about the pince-nez. I really like what you did with the eyes, though. I wasted quite a few minutes today playing with that thing (after awhile it becomes mildly hypnotic.) Quite a pleasant surprise, I asure you!

<P>Well, I'd be interested in seeing both. gopher might be more of a challenge, I think. I'm sure Napoleon would enjoy seeing herself meta-immortalized (I know had fun poking at my eye.)

<P>I'm not sure if I like the idea of Emsworth being able to poke meta-me in the eye... :P But meta-immortalization is cool!

<P>Your demand is my wish.
<P>I'm working on Napoleon now. I may have it together tomorrow. I actually think this might be giving me enough practice to be able to tackle the more complicated shapes required for gopher.
<P>Peace, Tim Bram.

<strong>Re: Meta-fanart (Emsworth)</strong>
<P>Wow!
<P>That is so cool. Rather like that bit at the beginning of Super Mario 64 where you get to manipulate Mario's head, minus the face-part stretching.
<P>At the moment, though, Emsworth's head seems to be upside-down and oscillating extremely fast, and I don't know what the heck I did to it. Seems that everything I touch turns to glod.

<P>Coincidentally, I just read &quot;Soul Music&quot; (and a few other Pratchett titles) last week. The &quot;elvish&quot; gag was all right, and Death's scenes as &quot;Mr. Scrub&quot; with the beggars were especially amusing. To say nothing of the Dean's motto: LIVE FATS DIE YO GNU!
<P>BORN TO EAT BIG DINNERS!
