<strong>Baby steps</strong>
<P>Clooooooser, clooooooooooooser. So I thought I might add Yahoo headlines to the autoblurber...
<P>Later, at home with his thumb on the current occupation of the concrete handwaving serving as always to wave the hands of the Social Security Administration to promote the president's view that the aura of the BoxJam crossover draws to a mere gathering of breath and energies on the environmental record of a lack of flamage at the end of the invasion of Iraq.
<P>Those fans who appreciate the well-honed metacartoonery of Toonbots Worshippers Jihad (PAFTWJ) as the perfect soundtrack to the shaded nuances of expression evinced by the feedback they received in meetings with constituents, Republican lawmakers returned to Congress this week convinced that it would take time to build support for President Bush's judicial nominees today, focusing on the part of the metacartoonist rings in the last is itself the joke in this episode; the metacartoonist is hopelessly derivative in the new century, off to a close with an all-star extravaganza strongly reminiscent of the significance and symbolism of such events, shows marvellous acuity in dedicating what may turn out to find killers of U.N.
<P>[It still needs tuning; I don't like the way it kind of sticks to either blurb style *or* news style but doesn't jump the tracks well. But that's not a Markov question. But then it came out with a true jewel just now, just genius:]
<P>Arrrrrr. First, it must be remembered that it would take time to build support for President Bush's still-evolving plan to overhaul Social Security. President Bush often quips that the metacartoonist simultaneously brings the storyline to date -- if the metacartoonist must do nothin. Second, you must be a veritable universe of clever and sophisticated allegory.

<strong>Navel gazing</strong>
<P>More navel gazing:
<P>A judge with the accustomed Toonbot insight on the traditional white caption background; all these accentuate the ineluctible expression of wind as the same is a masterfully interwoven tapestry of toon prowess and mild-mannered self-deprecating prankster-imbued joke/jest/social-commentary, and as such it is unconstitutional to sentence anyone to death for a song you never heard of, you pathetic excuse for a crime he or she committed while younger than 18.
<P>Of course, the redoubtable Lee Adam Herold , who is the loneliest number you've ever ... no, wait, that's one.
<P>If some of today's middle-school students have their way, people in the Democratic Republic of the White House intimidates visitors, leaving would-be critics to express only niceties.
<P>Ever responsive to the Jihad storyline, and also (2) how long it will surely be a simplification can be drawn with the joie de vivre of the metacartooning endeavor, all while remaining within the soul of the Congo (DRC), U.N.
<P>The subject matter is deceptively banal, indicative of an overhaul, Democrats in Congress charged Monday. On the eve of a Walt Kelley Sunday Pogo.
<P>The Supreme Court on Tuesday demanded an immediate and total withdrawal of all humanity, as intellect and passion are merged into one ethereal unit. The occasional crashing of the undrawn state. The metacartoonist wearies at times of demonstrating the fundamental lack of continuity tickles the apprehensive funnybone: no-one is left with a panoply of semiotic allusive constructs, each hand-picked at the cost of things like coherence and other fripperies of the People's Armed Front of Toonbots will probably sniff in disdain at Damonk13's sprawling chaos of a lack of metacartooning will need no reminder of the season, leading the Charlotte Bobcats to a great deal of union difficulties.
<P>Gerald Wallace showed up his former team with one of his government was gunned down by insurgents Tuesday -- one of his government was gunned down by insurgents Tuesday -- one of his government was gunned down by insurgents Tuesday -- one of his government was gunned down by insurgents Tuesday -- one of his son and ran out to be an actual storyline to date -- if universal, what need to visit the forum.
<P>[What?? This next one's really good.]
<P>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised both the Palestinians and Israelis for their &amp;quot;considerable maturity&amp;quot; in responding with restraint to a 94-87 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night.

<strong>Probably should go to bed, but...</strong>
<P>BAGHDAD, Feb. 28 -- Early Monday morning, Younis Qasim had sent his 10-year-old son to buy vegetables at the world to portray the unportrayable (BECAUSE NONEXISTENT) and instead turns his hand adeptly to the schooled observer.
<P>It's Christmas in September at Toonbots as the reliance of the principle of corporate greed with the court that will hear charges against Saddam Hussein and members of his son and ran out to examine the borderline between funny and not-funny, with the curtain closing Tuesday on the current occupation of the essential promise of minimal metacartooning; just as astounded as you are, Gentle Reader, that it's been a public service announcement.
<P>Is it due to BoxJam's inimitable greatness of soul, or due to BoxJam's inimitable greatness of soul, or due to the pathos, which is unwieldy.
<P>Thrill to the rather piquante meta-referentiality inherent in the Iraqi capital, according to an Iraqi police official and a possible move into the area by new competitors, local retail analysts and brokers say.
<P>Actual captions from the glaring light of today's middle-school students have their way, people in the Jihad, the metacartoonist refrained from metacartooning, and the Madonna and the life expectancy of men is drawing Ondine, but that doesn't even make sense ...
<P>The Bush administration is using the massive machinery of the public service announcement.
<P>And so the BoxJam crossover draws to a suicide bombing that appeared to be drawn between this inspired move and the life expectancy of men is drawing closer to the demanding standards of appreciation of the intersection of psyche with cosmos, that beach where memes evolve in their cognitive tidepools and cultural reefs, and you, Dear Reader, are given the chance to combine subtle frame-blending humor with sheer and outright ego(t)ism, mouse seizes the reins in her disappearance, and was suspended at sunset.
<P>Emsworth, of course, in real life is a spectre haunting meta-cartooning, the spectre of Communism.
<P>[Sorry, Emsworth...]
<P>They also urged other nations to help chart a more fully planned episode, for there are clearly more than 1 million victims last year.
<P>The Bush administration lacks statutory and constitutional authority to indefinitely imprison without criminal charges a U.S. citizen accused of leading a double life as the narrator (that would be to fall into the Divine.

<P>true, all true.....

<P>what?! just for a little disappearance?

<P>i knew about the haunting of meta-cartooning, but i must admit the communism thing is a surprise.

<P>well....you can certainly _hope_ that is the case....
<P>this is actually coming out quite well. you just need to get it to pay some minimal attention to grammar, and irritating things like not closing parentheses, and we'll never know it's not you.

<P>Yeah, that's kinda the point. But it's not that easy. (Well, of *course* not, otherwise the world would already be a very different place.) Markov chains are easy, but as I said -- it's all just statistics. There's no mental model, no syntax analysis. No way to make it make sense, if that were the goal, which I'll admit it isn't -- but my nonsense is at a higher level, more of a conceptual level. This stuff is entertaining, but the Bot's not going to write the blurbs very often. This is just a little taste of what might be to come. Eventually.
