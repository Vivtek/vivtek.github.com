<strong>Lord Emsworth more than Cool Enough</strong>
<P>'Cause he sent me a birthday card!
<P>I must, however, take exception to his accusation of &quot;increasingly surly and misanthropic behavior&quot; -- I've always been this surly and misanthropic. Also, I'm somewhat concerned that in the signature, &quot;All of Us in the Jihad&quot;, &quot;in the Jihad&quot; has been crossed out. That disturbs me.
<P>I'm impressed by the fact that the card is in French. That's a nice touch. And the vague prophecy regarding the Ides of March is intriguing indeed.
<P>And finally, I wish my scanner worked, because the little birthday wolverine is a really nice drawing.
<P>All in all, Lord Emsworth, a capital effort and a great achievement. A birthday card among birthday cards, and one you should be quite proud of. My only real question is: did you have accomplices, or were you working alone?

<strong>Re: Lord Emsworth more than Cool Enough</strong>
<P>&gt; 'Cause he sent me a birthday card!
<P>happy birthday! yay emsworth! (i am in awe of people who are organized enough to send cards)
<P>&gt; I must, however, take exception to his accusation of &quot;increasingly
<BR>> surly and misanthropic behavior&quot; -- I've always been this surly and
<BR>> misanthropic.
<P>well, certainly as long as i have been aware of you.
<P>&gt; Also, I'm somewhat concerned that in the signature,
<BR>> &quot;All of Us in the Jihad&quot;, &quot;in the Jihad&quot; has been
<BR>> crossed out. That disturbs me.
<P>he was worried earlier that the original members of the jihad no longer seem to be posting here...so i wonder if he feels the jihad has disintegrated - or just that he no longer feels part of it. i hope neither is the case (although 'all of us' is positive - thanks, em!) -- since such a large portion of the jihad seems to be in college, i am hoping for a pickup over the holidays. (is it actually possible to leave a jihad? or is it like the ira- 'one in, never out'?)
<P>&gt; I'm impressed by the fact that the card is in French. That's a nice touch.
<BR>> And the vague prophecy regarding the Ides of March is intriguing indeed.
<P>of course (she says grumpily) part of the dropoff may be because the forum is becoming even less comprehensible than the toon - between vague references to naughty puns in hungarian, cards in french, and that rant on pvp i'm like totally lost. (nobody never tells me nothin - grumble, whine, complain)
<P>&gt; And finally, I wish my scanner worked, because the little birthday wolverine &gt; is a really nice drawing.
<P>see? _another_ thing everyone just _talks_ about. he does draw cute wolvies, tho.

<P>Well, I guess if you're cool enough to like Toonbots, it's unlikely you'd suffer such an integral decline in your coolness.

<P>Ha!
<P>Ilya used to post on Case Yorke's site (Aren't We Real) but Case is ... MIA. I guess the rantitude just built up to the point where Ilya needed an outlet.

<P>well, i have a couple unused ones around the house he can plug himself into.
<P>i note that you are avoiding any explanation of the hungarian pun.

<strong>Re: Lord Emsworth more than Cool Enough</strong>
<P>Emmy is indeed cooler than belief! Wow. I took note of the fact that Michael said he had a birthday, and then totally forgot about it. So, ummm...happy birthday, Michael! I suck.
<P>&gt; i note that you are avoiding any explanation of the hungarian pun.
<P>It's probably a whole 'nother level of cool, you see. You have to be cool enough to be on the ecomic mailing list to be in on the joke. You and I should do a comic. We could call it 'Almost Cool Enough to Be Emsworth' and it could be about our zany mishaps while trying to be cool. (yeah, I just like saying 'zany'. You got me.)

<P>Hey, happy birthday Michael. Sorry for the lack-o-postings, RL has assaulted me with a brick labelled &quot;work&quot;. Just wanted to say that at least one Old-School member of the jihad is still lurking about, reading the comics, grumbling about the ever-present schedule to updates ;)
<P>I wonder if my name even appears on the list anymore... rotten reaper.

<P>Honorable individuals like student fretting over teacher remarks on double spaced document… reading too much between lines. While mindful that my wistful nostalgia may occasionally take a morbid turn, may I remind my learned friend that my initial comments regarding absent jihad members were in response to some early complaints about such absences and the lack of posts and responses in accordance with such. Any marks on the card may be attributed merely to certain personal tendencies towards uncertainty and limited ink and time and the result of general personal anxiety and concerns more than anything reflecting on the PAFTWJ. While I had talked about the card once or twice with Napoleon, I had not done so with anyone else, and it suddenly struck me that perhaps the initial signature might have been too presumptuous, and besides I'd initially meant to simply use &quot;All of Us&quot; which seemed to sound better and was much simpler but also apparently open to other interpretations as well.
<P>&gt; see? _another_ thing everyone just _talks_ about. he does draw cute
<BR>> wolvies, tho.
<P>::wolverines take a certain pride in providing suitable artistic inspiration, however::
<P>Glad the card arrived safely and that it was appreciated and all that.

<P>who, _us_? over/under/misinterpret things?
<P>besides, michael started it.
<P>(and i'm afraid i mostly remembered the morbidity and was concerned -- you can blame my personal neurotisism and free-floating guilt. and i _do_ hope you have more time or at least less stress over the holidays [altho now i recall some of my friends' stories of Major Holiday Family Togetherness - maybe i should just hope you have a nice long semester break to recover])

<P>The transposed digits in the zip code slowed it somewhat but it sure made my day. I'm still, even after a year, not really clued in on the fact that I have a fanbase, however small yet ardent.
