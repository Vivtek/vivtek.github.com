<strong>9/16</strong>
<P>Well! This cross-over certainly is looking intriguing! Wonderful panel layouts! Assuming the last dialogue caption is being attributed to the Bot, seems quiet surprising, but in view of the general upheaval, makes sense.
<P>And the blurb is another gem. Especially the reference to the &quot;Greystone Inn&quot; Narrator. Now *that's* a luncheon conversation I'd enjoy hearing.
<P>Mixed views about the &quot;newbie&quot; tips (as most of them should be apparent to anyone &quot;cool enough&quot; to read more than one strip.) Did conjure up an amusing image of groups trying to decipher Bot's dialogue, though.
<P>And yes, I have been following, just been a bit busy to post much.
<P>All in all, capital job, Mr. Roberts.

<P>I meant today. Except it was yesterday. As to when I am, the only possible answer is &quot;now.&quot;
<P>The time zone, however, is Indiana time. That means right now it's Central time, but when the rest of you switch your clocks back and we don't bother, it will be Eastern time. If you check your Windows time zone settings, you'll see that Indiana has its own entry.

<P>(Though I'm still inclined to doubt that you have any true intention of showing any wolverines within Toonbots during this cross-over. Still, there's enough other elements to keep one amused, and it seems as if the other strips may compensate. Personally, I'm rather hoping that we see Mao and Dick meet before this is all over.)

<P>Richard M. Nixon, who has achieved a new lease on life as a recurring character in FRAMED!! Considering Nixon and Mao's real life involvement, it would seem to me that a confrontation between their webtoon alter-egos is too good an opportunity to be missed.

<P>i wondered if that was who you meant - couldn't remember if he had gone over to china while mao was still alive (which would have meant they had _already_ met, and would now be renewing aquaintance). like i said, not as familiar with the casts of these other strips.
<P>&gt; Jackson Pollock has also had a significant presence in that strip as an

<P>wouldn't that then make it a significant _non_-presence? :)

<BR>> over to china while mao was still alive (which would have meant they had
<BR>> _already_ met, and would now be renewing aquaintance).
<P>As I meant to indicate. Mao and Nixon had indeed met in real life. For their webtoon personas, though, they might be renewing acquaintances, they might be meeting for the first time, who knows? Given the way Toonbots has presented actual persons (living and dead), Michael and the other collaborators could choose to ignore that fact entirely, if they like. (If you have time, might not hurt to read the incidents in Framed!!! leading up to this cross-over, but as those involved cross-overs with still other strips and artists, it might take a while. It's all been a very elaborate set-up. Pity Napoleon and her snail weren't invited to participate, though. A little defenestration could only add to the fun.)
<P>&gt; wouldn't that then make it a significant _non_-presence? :)
<P>I meant to say &quot;off-screen character,&quot; but he plays a significant role. If you'd rather use the term &quot;influence,&quot; that's fine, but he's certainly there, just not entirely visible. The reader's simply don't see his face, but he threatens the other characters with his tendency to toss paint and whatnot at people whenever he approaches. He's portrayed as a semi-stereotypical jungle wildman.

<P>well, true - if michael can have castro speaking in french, clearly any insistence on connecting this stuff with reality - well, sorta fails to connect to reality.

<P>*sigh* i keep telling myself i'm going to stop reading archives and do some real work......... (or i guess i could save time by not posting since nobody even cares _anyway_ *snf*)

<strong>Re: 9/16</strong>
<P>&gt; don't you _work_ in the basement?
<P>Um, well, yes. Fortunately I have a ladder.
<P>The basic construction of this house is excellent, although outdated in some respects (block basement instead of concrete) -- limestone veneer on a frame construction, nice house. But in between building it and my buying it, some real hillbilly put some &quot;work&quot; into it... The basement stairs being one of the results. Poor design; the steps are nailed in from the sides, but there's nothing holding the sides together at the bottom. The result is that over time the sides work away from one another, and given enough time, the bottom steps fall out.
<P>So I've ripped out the bottom five steps and I'm going to glue and screw them in instead of nailing. Or rather, in addition to nailing. I hope that'll help.
<P>&gt; (or is this just a new excuse re: wolverines? &quot;sorry, emsworth, i was
<BR>> _really_ going to put the wolverines in this time, but the basement stairs
<BR>> fell in&quot;)
<P>I *will*, eventually, put wolverines in. Not this week, though. Even if I weren't too busy with actual life, this Damonk crossover is real work to do.

<BR>> like with a rod or something, not like string -- altho maybe that would

<P>I'm not worried about aesthetics nearly as much as by the steps falling out of the stairs. I'm also thinking of a rod, yes. I think it's probably the only way to solve the problem. But I don't have a threader, so ... I guess I could just buy rods which were threaded all the way along....
<P>Good, mouse. You've just convinced me that's the best solution. Thanks. And you thought you weren't a hardware specialist!
<P>&gt; yeah, yeah, yeah - even _i've_ been around long enough to have heard
<BR>> _that_ one before.
<P>We haven't actually come to the end of &quot;eventually&quot; yet. The wolverines need some design before they'll make sense. (Well, as much sense as they'll make to start with.) Although I had considered drawing them as colored floating circles that have the capacity to open big, toothy mouths. But even there, the Toon-o-Matic can't draw toothy mouths yet. And floating colored circles without toothy mouths just lack a certain ... oomph.

<P>certainly they would lack any essential wolverineness (wolverines being neither circular nor floating, and rather inordinately toothy).

<P>&gt; The basic construction of this house is excellent, although outdated in
<BR>> some respects (block basement instead of concrete) -- limestone veneer on
<BR>> a frame construction, nice house. But in between building it and my buying
<BR>> it, some real hillbilly put some &quot;work&quot; into it... The basement
<BR>> stairs being one of the results. Poor design; the steps are nailed in from
<BR>> the sides, but there's nothing holding the sides together at the bottom.
<BR>> The result is that over time the sides work away from one another, and
<BR>> given enough time, the bottom steps fall out.
<P>&gt; So I've ripped out the bottom five steps and I'm going to glue and screw
<BR>> them in instead of nailing. Or rather, in addition to nailing. I hope
<BR>> that'll help.
<P>Eep.
<P>Good luck with all that.
<P>In re blurb etc. (Shush, Charles Ives.)
<P>It's been years since I took my one year of college German. How -does- 'innerlichkeit' differ from innigkeit?
<P>&gt; I *will*, eventually, put wolverines in. Not this week, though. Even if I
<BR>> weren't too busy with actual life, this Damonk crossover is real work to
<BR>> do.
<P>Am all anticipation.

<BR>> 'innerlichkeit' differ from innigkeit?
<P>Innerlichkeit: das Nach-innen-Gewandtsein; Verinnerlichung; Tiefe des Gemuets, des Innenlebens: seine Dichtung zeugt von einer starken I.
<P>Innigkeit: [mhd. innecheit]: das Innigsein, teife Empfindung; Herzlichkeit: die I. ihrer teilnehmenden Worte, ihres Blickes.
<P>Innerlichkeit is more a meditative quality; a monk has Innerlichkeit. Innigkeit is a more emotional quality. That's how I'd characterize it, but the difference is one of nuance. BUT more to the point, I wrote the blurb at 2 AM. Don't look for too much meaning.

<P>&gt; its seal witnesses from a strong I.
<P>eric, i think this may be a pointer to future toonbots directions; clearly this is pointing back to the penguin emperor (the &quot;strong I&quot;), and our proposed takeover of antarctica (which the seals would, of course, witness).
<P>&gt; Cordialness
<P>this means michael is inviting us all over to indulge in liqueurs. (thanks!)
<P>&gt; I. of its participating words
<P>this is less clear, but must again refer to the penguin emperor ('I.') - possibly pointing to a democratization of the takeover process - or maybe a upcoming slogan contest to popularize the toonbot cereal line.
<P>&gt; BUT more to the point
<P>so - when did we start worrying about the point?

<P>&gt; (or is this just a new excuse re: wolverines? &quot;sorry, emsworth, i was
<BR>> _really_ going to put the wolverines in this time, but the basement stairs
<BR>> fell in&quot;)
<P>Kept meaning to address this, but for the record, I've never expressed any great doubt in Michael's statement that he'll get to the wolverines eventually. I understand these things take time, do not wish to rush him unduly, and expect him to render them when he's able. It's not so much the fact that the wolverines haven't appeared as the fact that Michael has been using the &quot;NEXT: WOLVERINE&quot; panels to taunt us, as he surely must know whether or not he's able to render them yet. And the mere fact that he knows this has begun to annoy me slightly ensures that he will continue to use the gag, as it's typical of his surly, sometimes callous sense of humour to contribute to the stress and disappointment of his most faithful Jihad members. Jerk.

<P>Well, I'd say it's more the jerk BoxJam rubbing off on him than merely being presented as the orange guy in BoxJam's Doodle. The Orange Guy, as seen objectively within the strip, seems fairly harmless, and even rather amiable. It's merely BoxJam who views him as a jerk. Then again, as I've said before, it's probably inevitable that spontaneous combustion should take it's toll on a person's good humour.

<P>Not in that particular strip, true. In most cases, though, the &quot;Wait Here Sign&quot; is yellow. Been a little while sicne I'd closely examined that particular doodle, though I remembered the gag well.

<P>True. Whenever someone tries to discuss this with me I'm inclined to say &quot;Now, now&quot; (and pat myself reassuringly because the subject makes my brain hurt.)

<P>Certainly! Progressive thinking, (time zones caused by and causing) solar (per)plexity (enough obtuse puns and I will be doubled over in some sort of reaction, it merely remains to be seen which,) and in some events (surely not in -any-!) if you think this is bad... consider that on the Keen boards the Standard Time is Pacific, so if you're tapping happily away east of Mr. Roberts' Central (Mountain?) Time as you seem to be implying (likewise here- Eastern Time for me) then you're two (or so) more hours in the future ahead of the Keensp* boards.

<P>how can i _possibly_ be offended by someone who agrees with me? (and after all, _my_ running aimlessly askew from the subject got _you_ back talking again)

(which actually i could get into, except they seem to be having all these sharks) (we seem to have no sharks because they probably all froze to death this summer).
<P>&gt; All because someone decided that it shouldn't be day at 8 pip emma.
<P>well, not _now_ it isn't -- and isn't that a depressing turn of events? i'm considering migrating between the artic and antarctic circles myself (all daylight all the time!) -- except they both seem to have all this snow and ice stuff.
<P>did i tell you that the industrial revolution (abetted by coffee) brought about the modern concept of time? personally i think this was a Bad Idea (the time thing, i mean, altho the i.r. had its problems too) - i think with the internet and the global economy it is time to back to cottage industry.

<P>Much as I would like to rhapsodize on the gravitic forces of scatter (your ramble and - well - my brain .tout court.) - it was probably more relevant if more prosaic that I really needed a break from my latest music projects, not to mention expressing relief that some other work was done, and other things...

<P>No, on 2nd thought, although in a few days it will simply be Too Late for smiles and summer nights, I just don't live there. The wrong berg entirely, man.
