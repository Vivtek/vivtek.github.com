<strong>Pirates of the Caribbean - 13.9</strong>
<P>OK, I have to level with you. I liked Pirates of the Caribbean a *lot*. But my wife liked it so much, she not only saw it roughly 20 times in the theaters, it has become the new basis of her lifestyle. She actually dresses more piratically now. She'd talk like a pirate except that she already talks like a Hungarian.
<P>Anyway, there has basically been a complete and utter inundation of all things piratical in this household since we returned to America and saw what has become The Movie. We quote it incessantly. This has become such a completely overpowering influence that, I kid you not, I left the theater after seeing Return of the King with the distinct impression that what it most lacked was pirates.
<P>I'm hoping this effect will wear off at some point. I really like movies, and if I'm going to be mildly disappointed by every other movie that it wasn't Pirates of the Caribbean, that will blow.
<P>So, just in case you actually haven't seen Pirates of the Caribbean, at least one reviewer thinks you definitely should.
<P>Now that my wife has finished her doctorate in theoretical physics, our next plan is to build a brigantine and embark on a life of piracy, or at least treasure hunting. My own plan is a twin-hulled brigantine: the additional stability of the twin-hull catamaran design, plus the ineffable coolness of a tall ship. I'm there.

<strong>ahoy, me hearties! arrrrgh!</strong>
<P>(you should have expected this would encourage all the rest of us to talk like pirates. of course, now we will have to add 'talk like a pirate day' to the anniversary of the defenstration of prague on the list of official jihad holy days)

<P>plus, you can let the kids have one hull, while you and the wife get the other (and some occasional piece and quiet). just be careful about the cannon mounts - remember, you will only need them on _one_ side of each hull. you need some crew? (i would volunteer for first mate, but i have a suspicion that may be your post).
<P>ok, this is now on my list. my dear sweet thoughtful brother gave me a portable dvd player for christmas - so i think i need to acquire PotC for my personal collection. (yeah, i know - you'd think it would be easier and cheaper to just go to the theatre...but this would assume i have some ability to organize my off hours)
