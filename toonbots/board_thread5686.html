<strong>Goodness....</strong>
<P>My family doesn't know about my double life as a Web cartoonist.
<P>That said, my daughter has abruptly started drawing cartoons and wants me to scan them and put them on the Internet. She is determined to become ... a Web cartoonist. *snif* I'm so proud.

<P>&gt; My family doesn't know about my double life as a Web cartoonist.
<P>well, you are pretty much a stealth mode web cartoonist. what with, you know, you not actually putting any cartoons on the web. not that i'm critisizing.
<P>i'm sure there's some proper zen argument to be made here about about how expressing the essence of web cartooning being along the line of _being_ a web cartoon, rather than _making_ a web cartoon...but apparently the cough syrup is kicking in, and my logical facilities aren't up to the task.
<P>&gt; That said, my daughter has abruptly started drawing cartoons and wants me
<BR>> to scan them and put them on the Internet. She is determined to become ...
<BR>> a Web cartoonist. *snif* I'm so proud.
<P>seriously, you should put them up. encourage new talent, showcase another viewpoint - all good things.
<P>by the way - how did you family stumble onto your secret?

<P>Now, now, mouse...3 months of lag time is part of the master plan, you know. I think it's even built into the auto toon generator thingie. But I don't claim to understand programming.
<P>I'm just amused that Michael hides his deep dark secret pastime from his family. I'm signing him up for Jerry. I can see it now: Camera pans past an assortment of ne'er-do-wells, including our own fearless leader. The subline reads: Dark Family Secrets /Revealed/! And we sit patiently through the secret transsexual, the obligatory affairs, to see Michael break down on the stage, hiding his face in his hands. &quot;I just can't face them, once they know that I...I...cartoon!&quot;
<P>In other news, got a call from Emmy last night. Confused the heck out of Heow, I gotta say. He thought Emmy was a telemarketer. Heh.

<P>I vehemently reject the idea of a master plan. If only I *had* a master plan. Instead, I'm doomed to wander, rootless, and at the mercy of whatever rapacious bill-by-the-kilobyte provider happens to service the area in which I find myself. The DSL still isn't hooked up. They haven't even come to run the wire yet. So I'm still on the magic mobile phone, and my 300 MB ran out two days ago. Since then, I'm averaging $10 a day just reading my email and transfering files for translation customers. It's not comfy. AND I HAVEN'T EVEN READ SLUGGY FREELANCE FOR THREE WEEKS NOW!
<P>Granted, if I loved you all, I would be building up a backlog offline at the moment. But I can't work that way. I'm dependent on the adulation of my fans in realtime. (OK, I'm lying, actually I'm just too busy.)
<P>&gt; I'm just amused that Michael hides his deep dark secret pastime from his
<BR>> family.
<P>Yeah. Hardy, har, har.

<P>They always deny the master plan, right before they enslave the entire earth. Have you noticed that?

<P>It's okay. Pete broke his arm and it sucks just now. Guest strips for two weeks. Don't worry. And Grimbles is emulating your update schedule.

<P>&gt; He said Emmy sounded 'far too happy' to be one of our friends. Whatever
<BR>> that means.
<P>Mayhaps I should wait to call next time until I'm properly depressed?
<P>I had thought perhaps the confusion lay simply in the way I answered the phone, I know once or twice in the past, my formality and habit of asking for the [insert name] residence (quickest way to confirm one has the right number, to my mind) has been misinterpreted.
<P>Perhaps when I call again, I should quiz Heow as to whether or not he preferred the sharp or mild variety of L&amp;N Smoked Ants.

<P>I believe it's a sidebar in the Jihad charter, that in order to promote awarness of the glory of Toonbots, if one cannot convince someone, sewing random confusion and scaring the infidels works just as well!

<P>OK, I can see that one, actually.
<P>&gt; seriously, you should put them up.
<P>I fully intend to. She's a genius, of course.
<P>&gt; by the way - how did you family stumble onto your secret?
<P>They didn't. This was her own idea -- mind you, she knows I work on the Internet, it's difficult not to notice that one's father is always home and typing on his laptop and all, and that we have this amazing ability to leave the country on short notice.
<P>But no, the idea of making a cartoon appears to have dawned on her at school (she's going to school in Hungary again -- the odd thing is that after 8 months of home schooling in Puerto Rico, she seems to be better than her classmates on topics in her Hungarian textbooks, but then, she is frighteningly literate.) And the idea of scanning them and putting them on the Internet is her own. Maybe I'll set her up at Keenspace. Lenin wanted to do some Keen toons, too (he's not proud. Or tired.)
