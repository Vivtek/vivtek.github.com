<strong>Re: Hmm...</strong>

<P>It's just the index, and a while, apparently. You can get a sort of index by way of google, since it seems to have a good number of pages sorted, cached, and filed away.
<P>Or you could wait until my boredom levels reach critical mass and I just make my own index with the magic of wget and for loops. Hopefully those page numbers are sequential and consecutive.

<strong>third-party forum index</strong>
<P>&gt; How long have the forum archives been completely missing?
<P>Here ya go: http://gophernet.org/board_archive.html
<P>Has all 544 posts I could find, including 12 inexplicably empty ones. Assuming that the numbers really do increase in a chronological manner, it should be sorted from newest to oldest. I went through the trouble of parsing all the dates to get the range, so I guess could have sorted off of that, but eh. whatever.
<P>This post has been brought to you by a hideous shell script and the letter Thnad.

<strong>Re: third-party forum index</strong>
<P>&gt; Wow. You're completely insane.
<P>Huh. And that's even before you saw the regex maze I used. Like for dates, at first I thought they would be easy to grab, since they seemed to be the only things that existed withing i tags. Except that they weren't, since Michael is a bastard and went back and italicized things by hand. So I flew into a horrible rage and spat out this:
<P>s/.* \(\([[:alpha:]]\{3\}[[:space:]]\{1,\}\)\{2\}[[:digit:]]\{1,\}[[:space:]]\{1,\}\([[:digit:]]\{2\}:\)\{2\}[[:digit:]]\{2\}[[:space:]]\{1,\}[[:digit:]]\{4,\}\).*/\1/p
<P>Which seems to do what I want. I still haven't figured out why I wrote a POSIX-only regex while using GNU specific extensions in everything else. Whatever.
<P>But yeah, I'm totally nuts. I should be stopped.

<P>&gt; (I hate regexps. Does it show?)
<P>Oh come on, what's wrong with regular expressions? How else are you going to words of a regular language using only a horrible, unreadable single line of terrible characters not meant for human eyes?
<P>Sure, regular expressions can be unreadable and confusing, and I probably am going to hell for that text adventure game that I wrote in sed a while back, but they can be your friend if you treat them well and use them properly.

<strong>Re: Why I missed you guys!</strong>
<P>&gt; Awww! I haven't understood a single word of this thread!
<P>Oh, it's really quite simple. A regular language is any language that can be matched by a deterministic finite automaton (a finite state machine where at any state, it's known what state is next for any character in the input alphabet), and a regular expression is just a shorthand for that DFA. Also, you shouldn't listen to a word I say since I passed theory by blind luck and the best curve ever.

<P>well, that clears everything up.
