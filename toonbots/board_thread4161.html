<strong>Minority Report - 9.8</strong>
<P>OK, so you're asking, if I'm such a pushover for movies, how come I dinged this excellent one with -0.2? There was a logical flaw in this one. I think it's safe to give away the fact that the protagonist is accused of (going to be) committing a murder, and it's not giving much away if I tell you that the elapsed time between knowing this and the murder is 36 hours and change. So to avoid *the entire plot* our man could just have decided to lie low for two days. Jeez, what would *that* have cost him, eh? Nothing at all.
<P>THAT SAID -- wow. Remember how I bellyached about realizing the ending to Sixth Sense after the first couple of scenes? Well, Minority Report had me *thinking* I realized the ending. And then they sucker punched me! I had it all wrong! In several ways! And then after that I had it wrong again! Wow! Somebody in Hollywood managed to produce something that surprised me!
<P>So I'm happy.
<P>Additionally, the film treats us to a number of groovy future thingies without being *coff*Lucas*coff* heavy-handed about it. One I liked in particular was the animated, full-audio-video cereal box that Tom Cruise eats a couple of handfuls of sugar cereal out of. It triggers the animation, he beats it on the table top a time or two to get it to shut up (it doesn't), then tosses it across the room in irritation -- all completely casually scripted and fully realistic. Another: pervasive identification technology resulting in personalized ads everywhere. Imagine popup ads on the Net, except in every store you walk into. You walk into the Gap and a video screen greets you by name and asks you how your last purchase (by which I mean, exactly your last purchase, of those green trousers or whatever) is working out. And simultaneously, your location pops up at police headquarters if they're looking for you.
<P>In other words -- a very realistic look at the future in some respects. And some excellent action sequences, a couple of surprisingly well-thought-out scenes (hiding from the police in a mall with a precognitive -- a couple of *very* nicely done gags there), a good crime thriller plot, decent acting.
<P>If it just hadn't had the plot hole, darn it. Maybe I should give it a 9.9.

<P>Well, that's the only way to avoid a time paradox. Anderton lies low = Anderton doesn't commit murder = precogs can't have seen murder as it didn't happen = Anderton didn't need to lie low in the first place. (I suppose you could say the precogs were just wrong, there actually was a minority report, etc., but that seems like cheating to me.)

<P>&gt; Well, that's the only way to avoid a time paradox. Anderton lies low =
<BR>> Anderton doesn't commit murder = precogs can't have seen murder as it
<BR>> didn't happen = Anderton didn't need to lie low in the first place. (I
<BR>> suppose you could say the precogs were just wrong, there actually was a
<BR>> minority report, etc., but that seems like cheating to me.)
<P>No, it's made quite clear that once you have knowledge of your future, you still have a choice. Thus it's not a paradox if they see something and something quite else happens -- it's not time *travel* after all.
<P>So Anderton had the option of lying low.
<P>Why is it that in my memory of much of the movie, Keanu Reeves appears instead of Tom Cruise? Is it that Keanu *would* have done the movie, but then had the choice? Am I a retroprecognitive?

<P>God, I hope not.
<P>(ANDERTON sees image of a murder committed by him) ANDERTON: Whoa.
<P>(ANDERTON commits murder. MAN WHOSE NAME CHRIS HAS FORGOTTEN is defenestrated by the gunshot.) ANDERTON: Whoa.
<P>Etc.

<P>Dude, Keanu Reeves rocks. I've liked him since Bill and Ted. And I particularly liked him in the Matrix. Call it a character flaw. I just like the guy.
