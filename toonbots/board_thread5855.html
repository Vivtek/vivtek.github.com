<P>So if anybody is out there, hi. For perhaps the first time in the long hiatal history of Toonbots, I'm actually beginning to fear that, with Defenestration of Prague Day a mere month or so away, the Jihad has finally collapsed. Anyone care to prove me wrong, or has Toonbots fandom finally died at long lost, as a result of this last hiatus which has run a mere 10 months?

<P>we really _ought_ to do something for DoPD, this year - we seem to keep forgetting it.

<P>Mouse! I miss you. Well, that's someone. I'll try to come round and maybe even post some wolverine scans, depending on my situation then (school and funding are looking bleak). If Michael comes by, it would be nice. Otherwise, maybe we'll see him again in December. By now, even I can't help feeling Toonbots is officially dead and Michael's probably mocking us for sticking around so long, as in fact we've been guinea pigs for his wife's sociological science thesis or something. It would be just like him, orange jerk that he is.

<P>Boxjam denied that.
<P>It's not officially dead, just pining for the fjords.
<P>The paying work has been insanely good for the last three months. I haven't even had time to watch a movie since November. My plan really is to open up the Toon-o-Matic to the public, but I literally have not had a free hour since last year, between home schooling and household management and work.
<P>Soon, my pets. Soon.

<P>whoa. _that's_ pretty busy.
<P>but it sounds like things are going well, so that's good.

<strong>Re: *blub*</strong>
<P>i've been thinking about you - sorry to hear school is looking bleak. graduate school can be surprisingly different from being an undergratuate. do you still have my email addy? i _would_ like to know how you're doing. (and how the wolvies are doing, of course :D)
