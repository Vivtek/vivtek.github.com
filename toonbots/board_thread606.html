<strong>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</strong>
<P>Wow. I can see I've been missing out on this whole genre. This movie absolutely rawks, dudes! On so many levels, not least of which is, I really, really wanna learn Chinese now. Man! What a flick!
<P>Go see it. Tell me what you think.

<BR>> absolutely rawks, dudes! On so many levels, not least of which is, I

<P>&gt; Go see it. Tell me what you think.
<P>Well, I took the advice of the metacartoonist, and I greatly enjoyed the movie. Though knowing Chinese probably would have been nice and useful as far as watching the movie goes, I think I'd rather learn that flying thing that everyone did. Wonderful movie. I, too, wish that I had learned of this genre earlier.

<P>Isn't that cool? The flying thing? And apparently if you're talented you can learn it by careful study of the training manual!
<P>Next time I see it, I'm going to go without my daughter. Not that going with my daughter wasn't fun, but it gave me a headache leaning over reading the entire movie to her -- she reads extremely well for a six-year-old, but the subtitles were too low for her to see easily, and she hasn't mastered that look down - look up thing that you need.
<P>But that movie just really impressed me. Good, good movie.
