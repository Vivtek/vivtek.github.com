<P>Sunday's &quot;Rick and Bob&quot; (http://rickbob.xidus.net for those who were unable to deduce same) is a Toonbots parody. -H-O-O-R-A-Y-!-!-!- (Or not.)

<P>That's cool! Kind of weird, but definitely Toonbots!
<P>But ... it's not a Toonbots PARODY. The blurb, now, THAT was a nice touch, and I'll take the label of &quot;parody&quot; for that -- but the toon itself, that was just done in the well-known Toonbots style.

<P>Thanks!
<P>I wish I knew how Tirdun managed to do 20 of those without going battier, though. Doing one by hand was tedious enough... and it didn't help that I kept laughing the entire time I was making it.

<P>Tirdun is one of those &quot;special&quot; people, you know. And I laugh the whole time I'm doing an episode, too. It's the main reason I do this.

<P>That's why I laugh. I laugh at the thought of silly fans doing the same thing by hand. Silly, silly fans.

<P>We're a silly bunch.
<P>For the record, I did 23 Toonbots fanarts, 20 in the Communism saga, 2 Kaon and a T-shirt. And yes, I'm very &quot;special&quot;. As for how I did the communism saga, I started with just the one, and it made me laugh, and then I did 2 and 3 and kept doing them until I realized that I really should be doing OTHER things, and then Michael went to Hungary and so I finished the 20. Then I beat my head against the desk to reset my brain.
<P>I also note my posting is down... I've not missed any Toonbots, I assure you. I'm just swamped with a new project at work. (sigh).

<P>You obviously need to subcontract! ... Wait. I'm swamped, too. Never mind. Hold that thought.
