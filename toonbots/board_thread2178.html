<strong>Three films</strong>
<P>I note that none of the three films I saw in the last month (which were perhaps the only films I've seen since February or so?...) have been mentioned on this board, so I figured I'd ask about them here (hoping meanwhile that I'm not breaking any rules of etiquette in so doing; please tell me if so.) I wonder if anyone's seen them- &quot;Made&quot;, &quot;The Closet&quot;, and &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;. (I wonder too if I remember them at all well enough to help carry on an intelligent discussion. Well, perhaps I do.) Fun films all- I think &quot;The Closet&quot; was the best of them. I'd already seen &quot;The Dinner Game&quot; some while back which was as good. Only familiar face in Closet was Depardieu, but the acting was fine allround. Interestingly, the much-touted &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; was - though very very good- the least, imhonesto of the three.
<P>Final comment before I sleep: I haven't seen Vaughn's acting in &quot;Swingers&quot; or the &quot;Psycho&quot; remake, or Favreau in anything- I have seen Vaughn in &quot;Clay Pigeons&quot;. In &quot;Made&quot; he plays a very different role (seems to be a common thread of neurosis/psychosis and obsession; having a certain obsessive streak to my autism myself, there was something unsettling about his - very well-acted and characterized - Ricky...)

<P>Haven't seen any of those. Going to Europe always knocks a hole in my movie viewing.
<P>Anyone? Anyone? (What economics? D-o-o.)

<strong>We Three films of orion tar.</strong>
<P>I don't go to movies unless someone gets on the forum and splathers all over about how great it is and it's at the second run.
<P>I gotta say, though...Depardieu is a fine actor. I know it's popular to make fun of him, but he really is good, particularly in his native language. Sometimes I think I don't need to read the subtitles to know what's going on, cause he's emoting subtleties so well. Okay, so he was not particularly good in Green Card, which wasn't a good movie to begin with. Geez. Give the guy a break. Heh.

<BR>> over about how great it is and it's at the second run.
<P>As a general rule, I usualy tend to go to the movie theatres most often during the summer (though I only saw 4 feature films this summer), or if there's anything decent playing during Chistmas break (due to time and transportation.) However, I recently received a leaflet from the UTEP film society and apparently they'll be screening &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; some time in the spring. A little dubious about the title alone, but I might possibly consider seeing it at that point, if circumstances allow. We'll see.

<P>Well, it's more tense/violent (not very gory, though, I wouldn't say) than sexy... I guess the title takes some explaining, really, and in fact I'm still not sure I quite understand their choice... though the acting was excellent and I did enjoy the movie very much. I still rank it (by slight margin) least of the three. &quot;Made&quot; was more fun, and The Closet (orig. title. Le Placard) was best and funniest of them all (at times a bit sentimental, which I didn't mind.) (The IMDB listing and reviews are worth reading for this one- one reviewer mentions The Dinner Game/ Diner de Cons, which I however liked *quite* a lot more than the reviewer apparently did!)
<P>I saw all three of these in the local second-run movie theater(s, but owned by the same people) in the area, so they've been out for a little while, anyway.
<P>I don't think I saw any movies in June or July. I might have seen one or two in May!? No, I think it was April. I almost never see movies unless visiting my parents or being visited by them. Go figure...

<P>that's kinda where i'm at - even if i hear about good movies, by the time i get organized to see them, they are gone (and my experience tells me, and film playing on more than 1/4 of the screens at the local multiplex is not going to be my kind of film) -
<P>so i end up just waiting for them to hit the tube.
