<strong>I miss Snail Dust</strong>
<P>With fresh Toonbots still on my breath, I'm cuurently wishing I had some nice cool Snail Dust to wash it down.
<P>Wah! I miss Snail Dust! How much longer must we wait, Napoleon?
<P>(I would have posted this on the Snail Dust forum, but aside from the FOUR popup ads that appeared from viewing two pages of the forum last time I visited, it seems to have become a Teletubbies discussion board in my absence.)

<P>Those pop ups are a nuisance, aren't they? I have no idea where that Teletubbie person came from, though.
<P>Well, Napoleon has completed her finals. And had a birthday. So, I suppose a few days to a week off is acceptable. Still, I am also beginning to feel a bit restless as well due to &quot;Snail Dust&quot; deprivation, and so are the wolverines.
<P>

<P>The Teletubby guy is a... &quot;friend&quot;... I made off Napster. He stalks me from time to time, but he's harmless. I hope.
<P>I'm planning to start up comics next Monday. Either that, or as soon as BoxJam gets around to making a page of those spinoffs from ten centuries ago. Haven't decided yet.

<P>Better not use BoxJam as a measurment, I'm predicting that BoxJam making the spinoff page will be the first sign of the apocolypse.

<P>I'm gonna view it as the second sign. I actually got fan e-mail from someone I don't &quot;know&quot;...

<P>Surely these signs and portents fortell a glorious awakening of our collective qui. Or something really dark and forboding. Either way, we must prepare ourselves.
