<strong>Wooowww...</strong>
<P>So last night my CPU let its smoke out. I knew that CPU fan was going soon, but not that soon (it sounded like a hard drive was running all the time -- then suddenly it got quiet. And then my machine wouldn't boot any more.)
<P>So today I went to Staples to see what they had on sale. Mind, it had been two and a half years. ! So I spent $1258.00 today, on a machine twice as fast, twice the RAM, five times the drive space (all on one drive, too, leaving a bay free) with a CD writer and the Ethernet and modem already installed. And this snazzy new 19&quot; monitor, which wasn't strictly necessary given that the old one was still good -- but good is a relative term. As I told my wife, we can buy a monitor now, or new glasses soon, same money.
<P>This machine is soooooo faaaasssstttt! And this monitor is so crisp! I should have done this last year (except it would have cost a lot more money for this machine last year.)
<P>So I'm happy. Of course, the Toon-o-Matic is on this hard drive sitting on the desk in front of me, so it's not as happy. And I don't have telnet installed yet. Or my Inbox. Or my compilers, or Perl, or FTP, or wxPython, or Zope, or AOLserver, or my working folders, or ... damn. I have a good day's work ahead of me yet.
<P>There *is* no good time for a machine to die...

<P>My computer didn't -die- per se, but I spent the last week switching stuff from the old hard drive to a new one my friend's brother installed for me... it was okay, though, because it was spring break. And hey, what else would I have done with my break?
<P>So in conclusion, trout.

<BR>> you think out of date, think Iron Shamrock!
<P>Shyeeah. When you think out of date, think the 486 gathering dust under my desk, or even the 286 gathering dust in the garage. Don't think about the Pentium 133 which is my son's new computer, or the Pentium 400MHz which my wife and daughter have now inherited (as soon as it's back from the shop.)
<P>And after a day banging my head? Still don't have my data. I tried putting the drives into this machine. Either I boot off the old drive, and can't read the new one, or boot off the new one, and Windows Me refuses to see the old one (doesn't want to be in that kind of company I guess; the BIOS sees the old one just fine.) So I thought I'd put it in the P133, right? Wrong. Cabling or something, but if there are two drives in it, it refuses to read either. So I thought I'd boot off the old C: and just tell it to use the P133's network card, right? Wrong. It refuses. Spent three hours with that, refusing to acknowledge that it just can't not work. I was wrong. It obviously *can* not work. So I thought, OK, direct cable connection to the laptop and try to get at least the important stuff onto it. Wrong. No cable that I presently own, works.
<P>My current plan is to go to *&amp;(*&amp;@#$ Staples and buy a new (*&amp;@#($*&amp;@#($ IDE controller so I *can* read both drives on the P133, and boot from its own drive, which demonstrably works with the network card. Of course, since I've been horsing with the network card, it'll surely now refuse to work.
<P>I HATE hardware. If it weren't so durned hard to run software without it...

<strong>Re: Wooowww...</strong>
<P>&gt; There *is* no good time for a machine to die...
<P>I disagree. Last week my PII-233 at work blew a drive (the data drive, of course). After confirming death, I called in the IS department to get a new drive as to recover to. The nice IS gal mentioned that she had, in fact, just unpacked a pair of brand new PIII-933's and that if my boss were to, say, send an email mentioning that not only was my current computer in a poor state, but woefully short on power for what I do all day, there was a good chance that I might make the very top of the &quot;who needs a new PC&quot; list. Said list was to be evaluated that day to determine who got what.
<P>Long story short, this baby SINGS, SWINGS, COMPILES, and RENDERS. WOO!

<P>Yeah, I don't have Perl reinstalled yet, but I'm eager to see the difference in speed with the Toon-o-Matic (at least I have the data off the old drives now, including the Toon-o-Matic itself. That was a mildly frightening state.)

<strong>This is mildly embarrassing, but</strong>
<P>I really like Windows Me.
<P>There. I've said it! I admit it! (I've always rather preferred M$ for my desktop OS, weirdly, even though I'm leaning ever more towards open source for everything I actually *do* with my life.)
