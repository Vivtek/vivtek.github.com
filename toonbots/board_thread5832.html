<strong>Real life update, or, fun with kidneys</strong>
<P>So I'm not sure how explicit I've been about why I'm really on hiatus, i.e. where the real-life stress is coming from, besides the stressors that are always there, the money and stuff.
<P>Well, the main stress is this: my son, now six, might or might not have a kidney disease. &quot;Don't you have a diagnosis,&quot; you say? Wow. And here two years ago I might also have thought that the kidney was a well-understood organ, but in reality we, that is, humanity, have only a limited notion of why kidneys get sick, and no actual way to fix them once broken.
<P>So here's the problem: he has protein in his urine. About five times as much as should be there, and sometimes more. And he has *no other symptoms at all*. His blood values are perfect, he grows normally, he's active as a monkey on cocaine, no high blood pressure or edema (the typical signs of kidney disease). The outcome of this condition is vague. He could grow out of it. Or he could die on Mozart's schedule, even with the best today's science has to offer, because essentially, today's science has bupkus.
<P>&quot;What about dialysis,&quot; you say? Wow. And here two years ago I thought dialysis was a fix, a replacement for actual kidneys. Not so. It's better than *death*, mind you, but it will only keep you alive a decade or so, because of a variety of factors, such as that the kidneys have their dirty little paws in every fricking metabolic cycle in the whole organism.
<P>&quot;What about a new kidney,&quot; you say? Wow. And here two years ago I thought kidneys were, like, easy to transplant and stuff. Turns out that a new kidney will last five to ten years, too, and then will be rejected anyway. Then you can get a new one again, but this time your immune system is wise to *that* trick, and will be much, much pickier.
<P>And so on. Kidneys can't actually be fixed. And my boy's kidneys aren't working right.
<P>Anyway, we're doing what we can. We've talked to doctors in three countries now, if you count Puerto Rico as a separate country. (Well, nephrologists in only two.) Most want a biopsy. But now we've talked to a new guy in San Juan, who was a chief resident at Mt. Sinai in NYC, and he says a biopsy would be a waste of time.
<P>The kidney is composed of glomeruli, little sacks of capillaries, each of which filters a bit of blood and dumps the waste to be made into urine. There are about a million of them. A biopsy is an outpatient procedure where ten or twenty of them are snipped out and examined under a microscope. Only one problem. Many kidney diseases only affect some of the glomeruli, and even if they're progressive, it just means that more and more glomeruli are affected, not that they all get sick at once.
<P>So you have a limited probability of getting a sick glomerulus. But you still run a 5% risk of complication -- including kidney damage. Oy.
<P>The new guy says that would be stupid. We're keeping the new guy.
<P>Anyway, not like anything is resolved or anything. I just needed to vent a tad. My strategy is to keep the boy alive until science advances to what I consider a civilized level. In ten or twenty years, he'll just grow a new kidney on the spot, and things will be fine. And actually, chances are very good that he has that much time.
<P>But what really sucks is this: it's not 100%. He could die before they can fix this. I don't think any of my regular readers have kids. The possible death of one of your kids of something you essentially can't do anything about is really something I don't wish on anybody. Least of all me.
<P>And now you know .... the *rest* of the story.

<strong>Re: Real life update, or, fun with kidneys</strong>
<P>Dealing with my own stress right now (behind on my final papers and fighting sleep and migraines when I just want to go home for Christmas), but wow. I take back all the jokes about you being a jerk, Michael (well, most of them). A close cousin of mine has a son who was born with a heart condition, but that's hardly the same thing.
<P>I know we're not on the same plane faith-wise, but all the same, I'll be praying for you, Michael. Of course, I have an uncle who was born with an organ condition (can't remember if it was kidney or not) who's still around and over 60, and again, as you know, I'm a hopeless optimist. In the meantime, spend as much time with him as you can and *do* keep us posted. I know myself that sometimes it's hard to share personal stuff on the internet with (mostly) faceless people, even if you have known them for awhile, but we'll be *even* more patient (or heck, accept a hiatus of five years or so, well, almost, maybe, I don't know) if that's what it takes.
<P>And seriously, even if you are on the other side of the globe, send me your address. Maybe I can send a care package or some books for your kids at some point or something.

<strong>Re: Real life update, or, fun with kidneys</strong>
<P>i'm so sorry, michael. i don't have kids, so i can't exactly say &quot;i know how you feel&quot; - but i can make a guess.
<P>if he's asymptomatic (aside from the high protein thing) - how worried are the doctors? this is one of those things that make me wonder how well kidney function has been described - i don't know, for example, if my doctor has ever screened my urine for protein levels - because i have no symptoms. maybe the natural range is greater than they realize.
<P>i will be optimistic for you. i work at a medical school, and i know that there is lots of research going on about lots of things, so i will hope that one of them turns up something for your son. i know they are working on some new treatments to try to prevent rejection of a new organ without the patient having to be on anti-rejection drugs for their whole life. they've actually done it on a couple of people. and as you are probably away, much of the interest in stem-cell research is to try to do things like replace organs. (although in this case, i'll hope they can come up with something less drastic than an organ transplant...like, an understanding of what, exactly, is going on.)
<P>so keep hanging in there, and do whatever you need to for your son and family. we may be just faceless people on the internet - but it's funny how much one can come to feel for those other faceless people. so don't worry about venting - it does help. and we'll hope our good wishes help a little too.

<strong>Re: Real life update, or, fun with kidneys</strong>
<P>&gt; i'm so sorry, michael.
<P>Thanks to both of you faceless Internet people (actually, of course, you do have faces, because I drew them, so there.)
<P>&gt; if he's asymptomatic (aside from the high protein thing) - how worried are
<BR>> the doctors?
<P>Depends on the doctor. As (we're discovering) is often the case. But we've seen doctors on this in Indiana, Hungary, and Puerto Rico. In Ponce last April, &quot;a biopsy is mandatory!&quot; accompanied by a worried look, but in San Juan last month, eh, not so much. The Hungarian said that after a biopsy there would be about a 2% chance that there would be a treatable diagnosis, and our man in San Juan concurs with that. The difference being that the Hungarian wanted a biopsy to satisfy his own curiosity (well, it *is* a research clinic), but the San Juan doctor doesn't.
<P>Meanwhile, the nephrologists at Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis say that he would now qualify for referral, and (all else equal) a biopsy would be probable. This on relay from our old pediatrician in Bloomington, after several calls from Budapest.
<P>&gt; this is one of those things that make me wonder how well
<BR>> kidney function has been described
<P>Actually, they know a lot about how they work. What they don't know much about is how they break.
<P>&gt; i don't know, for example, if my
<BR>> doctor has ever screened my urine for protein levels - because i have no
<BR>> symptoms.
<P>If you've had urinalysis for anything recently, your protein will have been screened. It's on the standard dipstick (of which we have a bottle, just for our own relaxation; actually, last time we checked his urine with a stick, it registered normal protein, but the sticks aren't terribly accurate; they're really just for a stab-in-the-dark screen.)
<P>Typical symptoms of renal failure are edema (water retention) in the face and legs and elsewhere (like around the heart, killing you), high blood pressure, and ahem that's just about it for external indications. Blood workups pin it down better.
<P>&gt; maybe the natural range is greater than they realize.
<P>Well, kind of. There *are* people whose protein is normally high. This is &quot;benign proteinuria&quot;, which is actually his only formal diagnosis so far. Trouble is, it doesn't normally occur in six-year-olds. So the current nephrologist figures it's probably something more serious. But, as he says, it's just plain too early to tell, and so in three months we'll look again. And again and again until it goes away or something worse happens.
<P>That's the suckage of it, you see.
<P>&gt; i will be optimistic for you.
<P>Oh, I'm all kinds of optimistic, long term. There are three promising lines of research I found on one Google-and-reading session. Stem cells seem to magically promote kidney regeneration, there is a bone regeneration protein which also stimulates the kidneys, and I forget the third one (it's been a few weeks). And then of course there's the whole long-term work on just plain growing new organs in situ with stem cells. That will happen, of course.
<P>So there's very little chance this will actually kill him. The scary part is that if all research ceased, it *would* be what would probably kill him. Fortunately, it doesn't. Ever.
<P>&gt; i know they are working
<BR>> on some new treatments to try to prevent rejection of a new organ without
<BR>> the patient having to be on anti-rejection drugs for their whole life.
<P>Oh, now that's already nice, actually. If you didn't reject the transplanted kidney, it'd already be a significant step in the right direction. Cool.
<P>&gt; they've actually done it on a couple of people.
<P>*Very* good news. We have a friend currently on dialysis after rejecting one kidney (a physicist in Florida) and it would be nice if his next kidney would last him a little longer. Nine years isn't very long. He is getting quite the collection of kidneys, though.
<P>&gt; (although in this case, i'll hope they can come up
<BR>> with something less drastic than an organ transplant...like, an
<BR>> understanding of what, exactly, is going on.)
<P>Unfortunately, that seems not to be moving very quickly (depending on what it is, of course). There are a couple of different things this *could* be, and none of them is all that well understood. And all the kidney conditions are descriptive, very few say anything about the actual causes, because they're so poorly understood. (With some exceptions -- there are cases where your own immunoglobulins clog your kidney, for instance, as is the case for our physicist friend. So they know what the problem is with the kidney in his case, they just can't fix it or know what made his immune system turn out exactly the wrong size immunoglobulins. Right now it just seems idiosyncratic, which the immune system is good at.)
<P>&gt; so don't
<BR>> worry about venting - it does help. and we'll hope our good wishes help a
<BR>> little too.
<P>Good wishes and piles of hard currency. Nothing like financial crisis to spice up your worries about child mortality. But I digress.
<P>Seriously, I had a couple of serious slumps in 2005, and the rest of the year was stellar. If I could just eliminate the slumps and tone down the stellarity, I might have just a stable income in 2006. It could happen.
<P>And the whole translation thing is seeming to stabilize lately. More agency contacts, more return business, and I'm getting better at the actual translation as well. So that's good.
<P>I do have some plans for Toonbot-oriented development at some point, and they're starting to make some sense. So all hope is not lost for the Jihad. You're a patient crew to start with (you have to be) so I won't exhort yet more patience, but thanks for being there for so many years. You guys are great.

<strong>Re: Real life update, or, fun with kidneys</strong>
<P>you've just, like, tripled my knowledge about kidneys. of course, you are a bit more motivated to learn about them than i am :)
<P>and we're pretty used to waiting for toonbots. so get the finances together first.
