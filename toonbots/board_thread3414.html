<strong>Monster Clubhouse - 10</strong>
<P>OK, so, this isn't a movie -- it's a feature on Sesame Street. I don't know if any of you watch Sesame Street, but I do occasionally when I'm up that early and when my son isn't at daycare. Anyway, there's this new feature, &quot;Monster Clubhouse&quot; -- it is absolutely hiLARious. It runs about ninety miles an hour, except faster than that. Each little segment lasts about three seconds, like for instance a bell will suddenly ring, the monsters all say, &quot;NAP TIME&quot;, fall to the floor, and fall asleep, snoring in unison, and whistling the same song on the exhalations, and in two seconds they all jump up and go on with the show.
<P>Often, when the monsters say something, say, &quot;SNACK TIME!&quot;, then somebody will burst in, e.g. a duck says, &quot;Did you say QUACK TIME?&quot; etc. I particularly liked it when the duck misunderstood &quot;NAP TIME!&quot; as &quot;FLAP TIME!&quot;, the monsters thought that would be a good idea, and they all danced the chicken dance (dududududududUP! dudududududuDUP!) for roughly 2.6 seconds, *then* had nap time.
<P>At any rate, my favorite part was at the end, when the monsters say it's &quot;time to be chased by an elephant!&quot; and an elephant bursts through the wall and says, &quot;I say, would anybody rather play chess than be chased by an elephant?&quot; -- the monsters look at each other, say, &quot;NAAAH&quot;, and then the elephant chases them around for roughly 4.2 seconds (a long segment) while the clubhouse rocks on its foundations, then the elephant goes to the hole it broke in the wall, exclaims, &quot;My work here is done!&quot; and rampages off into the sunset.
<P>This is sheer genius. This is Sesame Street hopped up on goofballs, like Sesame Street hasn't *always* been hopped up on goofballs. I mean, I like Elmo's World, don't get me wrong -- but Monster Clubhouse, now that's good TV. I want to write for Monster Clubhouse when I grow up.
<P>Those wacky Children's Television Workshop people rock.

<P>y'know, this explains a _lot_ about toonbots.
