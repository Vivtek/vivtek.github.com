<strong>Happy Birthday!</strong>
<P>(To me.)
<P>I get to eat anything I want today. This should be prefaced with an understanding that we're all on a low-salt, moderate-protein diet for solidarity with our son. It's also keeping my blood pressure down and keeping the weight off that I lost in Hungary (I lose there because we walk everywhere -- the challenge is not gaining fifty pounds in car-dependent Puerto Rico).
<P>So I had taquitos and salsa for breakfast. For lunch we're going out to Chili's. And I have popcorn shrimp and tater tots lined up for supper. :-) Oh, and fudge brownie mix and an ice cream cake.
<P>Yum.

<P>It was marvellous.
<P>&gt; brownies _and_ a cake? you decadent fellow, you!
<P>Ended up not baking the brownies, but they're in reserve. My son's a little under the weather, so we figure maybe a big bunch of chocolate isn't what he needs at the moment.

<strong>Re: Happy Birthday!</strong>
<P>Mazel tov! So, Napoleon is wondering just how oooooold you are now, or if that information is classified.
<P>&gt; So I had taquitos and salsa for breakfast.
<P>Are you sure you're not part-Mexican? If you ever come back to the states, and are in the Southwest, come to El Paso. I'll treat you to Chico's Tacos, our own homegrown eatery, basically taquitos smothers in special sauce (popular as a hangover cure when the drunk teenagers come back from Juarez) and cheese. Mmmmmmm.

<P>Lechiam!

<BR>> that information is classified.
<P>39 years. I asked my mother how it felt to be the mother of a 39-year-old. She said it was horrible. I reminded her it would be worse next year...
<P>I was born on Election Day, 1966, after a horrible blizzard four days before. My mother was going door-to-door collecting absentee ballots -- for the Republicans! (She now says, &quot;Can you believe I was working for the Republicans?&quot; Ha!) And she ate a bunch of peanut brittle, got nauseous, and bam! to the hospital! It's a wonder I didn't go into a post-partum sugar coma.
<P>&gt; Are you sure you're not part-Mexican?
<P>It would have to be a pretty vanishing part. All my grandparents are pretty Celtic. My paternal grandmother claims descent from Tecumseh, that being the only real claim to any blood not from the cold parts of the world.
<P>Ending up in the tropics is a real eye-opener. Or pore-opener, rather. Metabolically speaking, I'm not really evolved for it. But I am starting to like it a lot.
<P>&gt; If you ever come back to the states
<P>Oh, well, we do that pretty regularly. Right now the question is the money. Big, big question. The move was followed by two rather flat billing months. Not good.
<P>&gt; I'll treat you to Chico's
<BR>> Tacos, our own homegrown eatery, basically taquitos smothers in special
<BR>> sauce (popular as a hangover cure when the drunk teenagers come back from
<BR>> Juarez) and cheese. Mmmmmmm.
<P>That sounds really, really good.

<P>Wow. You're actually four years younger than my half-brother, and eight years older than my sister. I forget, are you familiar with Jack Benny? He stayed 39 for more than thirty years or so.
<P>&gt; And she ate a bunch of peanut brittle, got
<BR>> nauseous, and bam! to the hospital! It's a wonder I didn't go into a

<P>No wonder you wanted fudge and such for your birthday.

<BR>> to like it a lot.
<P>Though less extreme, I'm having the reverse adjustments here, having come from a place where 60 degrees is cold weather, sleet is unknown, rain minimal, and wearing thermal underwear will cause you to either get a sweat rash or die of overxposure.
<P>&gt; That sounds really, really good.
<P>It is. Of course, the atmosphere is also part of it: the milling lines, the blaring jukeboxes, the odd juxtaposition of low income families (an order of three taquitos for years was 80 cents, now it's a buck something but still pretty cheap), aforementioned teenagers, and scary &quot;You lookin' at me, ese?&quot; style cholos and drug dealers and such. It's part of our local culture and traditions. There's a very amusing thread on Chico's at epinions.com: http://chefmoz.org/United_States/TX/El_Paso/Chico's_Tacos944333684.html
<P>Urging all tourists to eat there, but to get back to their own hotel before they have to use the bathroom, since yes, the Chico's restroom facilities are as nearly legendary as the food.
<P>My sister was disappointed we weren't able to buy her one of the Chico's Tacos anniversary t-shirts. My dad, on the other hand, usually eschews the tacos and has a strong preference for the hotdog burger (four huge sliced wieners on a hamburger bun, with mustard and green chile sauce and such).
