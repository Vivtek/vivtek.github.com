<strong>In memory of a Jihad member...</strong>
<P>Eric Timothy Baars, known on the Toonbots forum as Sir Timber Bram, knight artificer of pixels, passed away on October 23 at the age of 34. He had been suffering from Hodgkin's for several years, and his most recent chemo treatments had not been going well (which is part of the reason he hadn't been posting in recent months.) Despite that, I had still hoped he might recover well enough to join Napoleon and I in San Diego. He was a Christian, was a computer technician or enginer by trade and also something of a grammarian, and lived in Canada. In as much as one can know a person strictly through online communication, he was a gentle man, polite and friendly and never one to contribute to flame wars but would firmly yet civilly put his foot down when needed. I first met him on the Class Menagerie forum in 2000, and eventually introduced him to Toonbots. He always maintained a positive attitude despite his condition, and had a good sense of humour, always amused by the wolverines and appreciative of their affectionate natures. It had been months since we had exchanged e-mails, though I had sent him a card earlier in October, which I can only hope he managed to see before he went.
<P>Farewell, Tim. At last you are at peace, but you made an impact on my life, and on others as well, and we will never forget you.

<BR>> positive he was, despite his condition. he will be missed by many.
<P>That's one of the many things which I respected about him, and struggled to emulate when going through my considerably less harrowing recovery. I really had hoped he might recover, and in our last e-mail exchange, back in July, he was upbeat about the radiation treatment. I still remember the VRML images he made of myself and Napoleon.

<strong>A small eulogy</strong>
<P>&gt; Eric Timothy Baars, known on the Toonbots forum as Sir Timber Bram, knight
<BR>> artificer of pixels, passed away on October 23 at the age of 34.
<P>I am greatly sorrowed to have lost a jihad bretheren, deepened by the fact that I will never know Sir Bram as more than a passing acquaintance or humorous poster on the board.
<P>We are less for having lost him, greater for having known him, burdened by grief for his death, heartened by the joy of his life. May his rest be peaceful. May his life be an example. May our movement forward in life be guided in some small way knowing we live on where he will not. I propose a small symbolic toast to Timothy Baars.
<P>To his life, his death is not a battle lost, but the end of a long battle won.
<P>To Sir Timber Bram.

<P>Hear, hear!
<P>Um...
<P>Should Otu be gnawing on the casket stand like that?

<P>I'll miss him. He was quite a nice guy. Thanks, Emsworth, for passing on the news.
