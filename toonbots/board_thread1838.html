<strong>Trotsky!</strong>
<P>In order to pay reparations for my sugguestion of a here-unnamed fascist as a potential Toonbot's communist, I'll throw Leon Trotsky into the ring instead. He's dead, he was a communist, and (the best part is that) he was assassinated by Stalin. How can you beat that? The ghost of Trotsky haunting Stalin! If only he'd been defenestrated.

<strong>Re: Trotsky! (and wolverines)</strong>
<P>&gt; he was assassinated by Stalin.
<P>I'm not dyslexic, I swear, but I read this as 'assassinated by Satan'. Then went back and read it the same way again.
<P>Now /that's/ cool. Assassinated by the dark lord himself.
<P>Anyways, I think Trotsky is a good choice. The name alone makes me giggle.
<P>As a side note, anyone else see the Simpsons this Sunday? Wolverines! Loads of 'em!

<P>Even better was Trotsky's view on communism, which was labeled &quot;Trotskyism&quot; by Stalin. I enjoyed an episode on the History channel in which the poor narrator had to discuss 6 or 7 really long Russian names and the words &quot;Trotskyism&quot;, &quot;Bolshivikism&quot; and other &quot;ism's&quot; for an hour.

<P>Actually, I do sometimes wonder why so many seem to have difficulty spelliung &quot;defenestration.&quot; It's a relatively simple task, really.
<P>Just recalll that old spelling rule: &quot;i&quot; before &quot;e&quot;, except after &quot;c,&quot; and &quot;n&quot; before the third &quot;e&quot; in defenestration.

<P>My mother used to sing a version of this to me in the cradle:
<P>'I' before 'E', except after 'C'. Or when sounding like 'A', as in Defenestray.
<P>(I posted at the same time as Emsworth now! I'm channelling all the long term members of the Jihad, one at a time!)

<strong>Tirdun's Dictionary of Defenestration</strong>
<P>I'm just going to start making up my own Defenestration words... like:
<P>Defenestationarialism: (noun) The belief and/or theory that the worldwide use of defenestration will bring about positive global changes. The antonym of which is Antidefenestrationarialism.
<P>Intradefenestrationectomy: (noun) The elimination of a member of a group or organization by defenestrating him or her during a meeting of said group.
<P>Defenstrationism: (noun) The philosophy in which there is a belief in defenestration as a higher order of knowing, either gained by defenestrating someone or by being defenestrated. The opposing theory is Adefenestrationism or Nondefenestrationism.
<P>Protestidefrenstrationism supports the belief that a person must have been both the defenestrator and defenestratee in order to achieve knowing. Veridefenestrationists, on the other hand, support the belief that only by BEING defenestrated can a person achieve knowing, and that defenestrating others is simply an act in support of the person being defenestrated. While this act may bring pleasure or produce other feelings, it does not have any philosophical benefits.

<P>I'm not sure the fabric of the universe could withstand a Jihad union. I was worried enough about you and Emsworth in physical proximity, but besides that flood in China, there weren't any dire consequences.
<P>Can you ... can you imagine their *children*?
<P>My God. I just realized they're the only two Jihad members to have appeared in the *same episode*!!

<P>I don't know, my wife has been saying how very much she'd like us to add a third member to our union... from the internet. The fact that she's both an online comic artist and a member of the Jihaad will all but close this case ;)

<strong>Five Wolverinemen of the Jihad</strong>
<P>&gt; Well, *Tirdun* thinks it has two.
<P>I had tried to start a second Jihad, notable only for the fact that it had two &quot;a&quot;'s, but nobody seemed to want to join up. A few openly mocked me. Just a few. Ok, most of them. The others didn't notice that it was a second Jihad and so probably lost the chance to mock me as well.
<P>Actuaally, I don't know why I staarted using the double &quot;a&quot;, it is raather aannoying aand I think I'll stop.
<P>On that topic, for the life of me I can't find the original post anymore over at keenspace having to do with the creation/naming of the Jihad. It could have something to do with the pathetic search tool, or fate. I'm leaning toward a deficiency in the tool. TOOOOL.

<P>I believe it was on Lee's forum -- but post-Jihad, his boards crashed (I crashed them, I think). So it may have been lost (even though most of the threads were recovered.... So I don't know.)
<P>It was, however, under &quot;People's Armed Front of Toonbots Worshippers Jihad&quot;. And I'm almost positive it was with one 'a'.
