<strong>Fan XML</strong>
<P>Well, as my humble fan art has been called &quot;inspired&quot; by Vanity Fair and &quot;The best movie since Shindler's List&quot; by that annoying critic who'll take cash from anybody for a decent review, I've written what I think is the approx. XML source code for it. I'll post it in the follow up thread, for anyone who wishes to bother with it, it's mainly an excercise for me to explore the mysteries of the Toonbots experience. Two notes, first I think it exceeds the text limits for a caption, since I can't find any captions with as many characters and second, I don't know that Al has a left facing. Regardless, it was fun to try out.
<P>

<P>It's a good question whether the captions will fit -- I don't have any text metrics functionality, so I can't break lines. Not that I can place text in multiple lines anyway.
<P>I still don't have the Toon-o-Matic running again yet after the migration to the new machine, so I can't run this through it, more's the pity. Now I'm more motivated....

<strong>Another thing</strong>
<P>By the bye, the newly rewritten Toon-o-Matic should be a lot more portable. If that's the case, I'm going to install it on the server for everyone's enjoyment. But it's going to run *really* choked down, and queued, because I can't afford to get slashdotted. So it might email you a link to the result or something.
<P>And THEN by golly I expect to see some fan art action.
