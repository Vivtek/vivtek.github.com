<strong>Defiance against social standards</strong>
<P>...or the Metacartoonist's counting skills. Wondering which. From the page provided by vivtek.com upon a 404 error:
<P>You step in the stream
<P>the water has moved on
<P>page not found
<P>Now, due to the layout and theme of this little poem, I am going to assume that it is an attempt at haiku. Purists may say that the lines of haiku must be five syllables, followed by seven, followed by 5. However, acceptable haikus have been made in the form 3-5-3, and I have even seen one that was 1-3-1. However, 5-7-3 seems a little odd. Almost as if the metacartoonist (I assume it was he who wrote this) began a 5-7-5 haiku, then got confused somewhere around the middle. So is this an error, perhaps caused by evil gremlin saboteurs, or is the Metacartoonist experimenting with a revoluttionary new haiku style?

<P>. . . and 5-6-3 seems even odder. Or were you pronouncing &quot;moved&quot; with two syllables? Not that I'm trying to nitpick or anything. :)
<P>(By the way, I've been reading this strip for a while, but I was only pointed to the forum today. Thank Lord Emsworth for my wonderful presense, sparkling repartee, and extreme modesty.)

<P>D'oh! I was working on some linear algebra homework at the time; I suppose that this sort of thing is why the answers kept coming out wrong. And the 5-6-3 also supports the theory that Michael got confused &quot;somewhere around the middle&quot;, it was just a little bit sooner than originally thought.

<P>Actually, this pseudo-haiku was in an email list of computer haiku a few years back, and I just really liked it. I never even bothered to count anything.
<P>Hi, Simon! Apparently I'm going to have to make my forum link more prominent or something.
