<strong>Inspired by recent talk of revolution...</strong>
<P>Do you hear the jihad sing,
<br>'Tis the song of unorthodoxy,
<br>It is the music of a people
<br>Who are slightly odd, you see
<br>When the beating of your heart,
<br>Echoes the confusion of your brain,
<br>There is a chance they'll toss
<br>You out through a window pane
<br>The High Chancellor will show you
<br>What defenestration means,
<br>And if it doesn't take,
<br>We have the springing wolverines,
<br>Perl scripts, and commies and the Dot and other strange things!
<br>Can you hear the jihad sing,
<br>It is the cry of the Toonbot,
<br>It stands for a webtoon
<br>Which updates less often than it ought
<br>When the beating of your heart,
<br>Matches the throbbing of your head,
<br>Then you need for Chairman Mao
<br>To come and holler "Hey, Fred!"
<P>(with apologies to &quot;Les Miserables,&quot; and I hope this formats correctly. I though the jihad could use an anthem, but if anyone else can come up with something better, feel free to do so.)
<p><font size=-1>With help from the metacartoonist anything formats correctly -- Michael</font>

<P>That ROCKS.
<P>It'd be even cooler if I knew how the tune went, but still... that ROCKS.
<P>'Specially since it mentions me! ;)

<P>&gt; That ROCKS.

<P>&gt; 'Specially since it mentions me! ;)
<P>Why, thank you. Pity the spacing didn't come out right, though. I'd probably need to do another chorus, if I could figure out how to fit anyone else (maybe I should have used gophers instead of commies, especially since I mentioned Mao.) (Also at least one typo would up in there: should be heart instead of &quot;heat&quot; in the fourth line.)
<P>I did a search found a link to a &quot;Les Miserables&quot; site with the original lyrics to this song. More importantly, it has an extremely brief sound clip from that song (&quot;Do You Hear the People Sing&quot;) available as a Zip file. (At least you'll know the tune for the first few bars.) Here's the link:

<P>Fixed it, and eliminated the double spacing. There's not a lot you can do with WebBBS unfortunately. I *also* fixed your shamelessly unorthodox spelling of &quot;unorthodox&quot;. You keep doing that. It drives me crazy.
<P>I gotta get me the MP3 to that. Downloading more Communism, mwuhahahaha.
<P>And Emsworth? That &quot;updates less often than it ought&quot; bit? You just did that because it rhymes and scans correctly, right? RIGHT?

<strong>Do You Hear the Jihad Sing? (hums to himself)</strong>
<P>&gt; Fixed it, and eliminated the double spacing. There's not a lot you can do
<BR>> with WebBBS unfortunately.
<P>Actually, I also wanted spaces between stanzas, but oh well. No point in being picky.
<P>&gt;I *also* fixed your shamelessly unorthodox
<BR>> spelling of &quot;unorthodox&quot;. You keep doing that. It drives me
<BR>> crazy.
<P>Must be a short trip. (Forgive the rudeness, I couldn't resist the opening.) Seriously, I considered &quot;unorthodoxitude,&quot; but the only rhyming adjectives I could think of were &quot;rude,&quot; &quot;crude,&quot; &quot;lewd,&quot; and &quot;nude.&quot; (None of which I thought would help the Jihad's image.)
<P>&gt; I gotta get me the MP3 to that. Downloading more Communism, mwuhahahaha.
<P>If Napster's still up, I'll have to see if they have that as well. I've never used Napster before, actually. I really like &quot;Les Miserables&quot; for some reason (the book and the musical.)
<BR>> And Emsworth? That &quot;updates less often than it ought&quot; bit? You
<BR>> just did that because it rhymes and scans correctly, right? RIGHT?
<P>Actually, yes. I felt I needed to include a direct reference to the comic, as well as the jihad, and that line scanned perfectly, and rhymed with Toonbot. Maybe I should ahve waited and refined the thing. Ah, well.
