<strong>2006!</strong>
<P>Well. So. It's January 1, 2006. I am back in Ponce, and I have a lot of debt to pay off that isn't getting any smaller as I type this.
<P>But *this* year, it's going to be different. We're not going to move for a while. Well, actually we will, but we're limiting ourselves to staying in the same town. Looking for a cheaper place.
<P>And we've found one, actually, a nice little house in a neighborhood in biking distance from the beach, next to the Hilton. We're pulling the kid from school and we're just going to homeschool on the beach and take it easy for a few months. The older kid is still homeschooling, but #2 decided he wanted to try school for a while, and he liked it in many ways, disliked it in others. I think he underestimated how much time he'd be forced to, you know, not run in circles yelling at the top of his lungs about Transformers. But that's a different story.
<P>Speaking of Transformers, we Bittorrented a Japanese Transformers episode and the kids and I watched it and tried to figure out what the heck they were saying. It was very cool. In a geeky way.
<P>Speaking of geekiness, does anybody else like the TV show the Monk? My wife loves it and it's growing on me quite a lot, too. Good stuff.
<P>Back to work, Michael. Bad metacartoonist, no cookie.

<P>&quot;the monk&quot; or just &quot;monk&quot;? i've seen a few episodes of &quot;monk&quot; (starring tony shalhoub as an obsessive-compulsive detective) - i rather like it, but i haven't gotten in the habit of watching it - it's on a couple different channels, so i'm never quite sure where to find it.

<strong>Monk</strong>
<P>&gt; &quot;the monk&quot; or just &quot;monk&quot;? i've seen a few episodes of
<BR>> &quot;monk&quot; (starring tony shalhoub as an obsessive-compulsive

<BR>> watching it - it's on a couple different channels, so i'm never quite sure

<P>That's the one! I love that show! And I don't even really watch TV on a regular basis. It's on USA on cable.

<P>yes - and it is (or was) on another channel - they keep making these deals now where one channel produces the show and then licenses it to another channel for broadcast, or some such thing.
<P>but i really like tony shalhoub. have you seen &quot;the big night&quot;? that was such a nice movie.

<P>It was only briefly on ABC, if memory serves, in the early episodes, which I only caught one episode of. You cable-owning people don't know how good you've got it.
