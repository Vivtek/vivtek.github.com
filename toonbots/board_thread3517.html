<strong>Return to Neverland - 8.5</strong>
<P>Disney heavyhandedness on the whole war theme at the outset marred this movie in my own opinion, but other than that -- *DAMN* but the pirate-ship-over-London sequence rocked. That alone was worth the price of admission, that and the fact that this is, I believe, the first movie my son has ever sat all the way through. ... That's not quite true; there was another, but I don't remember what it was. Well, certainly one of the few he really enjoyed, start to finish.
<P>Good flick. Very, very good pirate ship. Hook was excellent -- in fact, all-around good writing, except for Smee, who (forgive me) just was *too* much like Droopy for comfort.

<P>Reluctant to see this film, despite being an amateur animation historian, particularly as I loathe Disney's current tendency to cannibalize past classics, and the success of this film can only encourage their current plans to release &quot;Snow White 2&quot; as a direct-to-video. For the record, though, rather interesting comparison of Smee to Droopy. In the original film, Smee was played by Bill Thompson, who not only provided the voice of Droopy, but whose &quot;Wallace Wimple&quot; character on the radio had inspired the character to begin with!

<strong>Everybody do the Disney Bash!</strong>
<P>I really hate Disney. Well, lets say that I really hate the new Disney.
<P>I used to really love Disney.
<P>Now I'm all sad.
<P>But I knew that voice was familiar! Thanks, Emsy, for clearing up two decades of frustrated confusion. Did he also do someone in Robin Hood? The Sheriff of Nottingham, maybe? That's another voice that drives me insane with it's familiarity.

<P>No, as a matter of fact, as Bill Thompson passed away in 1971, prior to the release of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; in 1973. (His final voice role was as Uncle Waldo in &quot;The Aristocats&quot; in 1970.) However, the Sheriff of Nottingham was played by a familiar voice, that of character comedian Pat Buttram, who aside from serving as comic relief in several old Gene Autry Westerns, is probably best remembered for playing Mr. Haney on TV's &quot;Green Acres.&quot; In addition, Pat Buttram was heard in a few other Disney animated features, playing Napoleon (no relation to the High Chancellor) in &quot;Aristocats,&quot; hick muskrat Luke in &quot;The Rescuers,&quot; and hunting dog Chief in &quot;The Fox and the Hound,&quot; in addition to bits in later films &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (Bullet #1) and &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (Possum Park Emcee.)
<P>For further information on Messrs. Thompson and Buttram, see the following pages:
