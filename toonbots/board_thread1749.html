<strong>Tomb Raider</strong>
<P>I'm pretty sure that having the plot in Hungarian helped this movie, because it lent it an air of mystery which would otherwise have been absent. That said, I enjoyed myself immensely. It was a nicely shot (if clumsily screenwritten) movie.
<P>Anybody else see it?
<P>I gotta say, however, that one of the previews gave me a nasty shock, which I told my wife sitting next to me: I had a terrible vision that the planet had been taken over by apes and they ALL SPOKE HUNGARIAN. Ow. My arm still hurts little where she punched me.

<P>*eyes Tirdun nervously*
<P>Um. Wouldn't, as humans...wouldn't we want to thwart the HUNGARIAN APES? I mean, I didn't see any trailers or anything, but I'm almost certain that the apes enslave humanity (I saw the original, but frankly? It seemed like a good movie to have a beer with. And then another. So I'm a little hazy on the details...)
<P>I think his last post is evidence that Tirdun is, in fact, a card carrying HUNGARIAN APE sympathizer.
<P>Or even worse, a real live HUNGARIAN APE!
<P>I think that it's our duty as red blooded non HUNGARIAN APES, to convene a tribunal immediately to look into this serious matter. I call for a special committee to be appointed.
<P>(Can I have the bear's hat if Michael gets assassinated by the RPIB?)

<strong>Codewords</strong>
<P>Here at the Organization for Originally Procuring Stuff, we are always on the lookout for hidden messages from those subversive Hungarian Apes (or, as we like to call them, apies or Oranges (from Orangatuan! I kill me!)). We do this as a not for profit service for you, the tax payer.
<P>&gt;tirdunisnotanapesympathiseroranape
<P>Though this string of letters might look totally innoculous to the naked eye, upon running the string through the Findometer, our trained professionals noted the presense of the following word, a known code word for Orange operatives: ranape.
<P>Our suspicions were aroused, and the hunt was on.
<P>Parsing the string with the Electroparsometer revealed a telling number of tantilizingly partial words:
<P>tird uni snot an a pesymp a this ero ranape
<P>Clearly, this was an attempt at smuggling coded information out of the Jihad to the Oranges. Running the string through various high tech devices revealed:
<P>Portugese: tird I matched snot an pesymp the this ero ranape
<P>Russian: tird uni of snot AN and of pesymp and of tyuis yero to ranape
<P>Japanese: Tird uni snot an A pesymp A this ero ranape
<P>We were getting nowhere. Until a brilliant young scientist guessed that the sentance might have the old 'flipped vowel' code applied to it and we switched each vowel one back, getting:
<P>terd one snit yn y pasump y thes ari rynypa
<P>Translated, this reads:
<P>Russian: terd to one dreams yn y of pasump y of tyues of ari of rynypa
<P>Portugese: terd one snit yn y pasump y thes ari rynypa
<P>Japanese: Terd one snit yn Y pasump Y thes ari rynypa
<P>Ah-hah! Taking the relevant words out of each sentance, we discover the final secret message, smuggled out of the Jihad in the harmless guise of a search engine string:
<P>Tird I matched one dreams an a pesymp a this ero ranape.
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jihad! We must take action and protect our pesymp from the nefarious Tird! Otherwise, our ero will go the way of the Dodo, the Giant Ranape, and the Tazmanian wolf!

<P>Nah. Jihad rules say the new person has to stay in the wolverine pen for a week before getting one of the rooms.
<P>(Granted, that IS the original code from 1392, which also says we all have to wear sentient abacuses on our heads when within a furlong of any other Jihadder, but still.)

He goes by his middle name out of sheer frustration at the number of Michaels. That, and he got really tired of people running up to him and shrieking 'Michael?!?! The one who does Toonbots?!?!

<P>Must be my age. (My sister's name, of course, is Jennifer.)
<P>By the way, the answer for casual sex is, of course, &quot;yes,&quot; but the answer for childbearing is a qualified &quot;no&quot;. I only have time for the two kids I've got. If the prospective screaming fan can, however, convince me that my love child will be reared in a caring and well-supported environment, then I can make the occasional exception.
<P>(Yes, I *do* have an active imagination. Why do you ask?)
