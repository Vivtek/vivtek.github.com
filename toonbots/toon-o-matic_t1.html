<h2>The amazing Toon-o-Matic</h2>
<hr>
Yes, this is the home page of that astounding drawing software, the amazing Toon-o-matic.  Largely vaporware, the
Toon-o-Matic takes a description of a cartoon, style information, character descriptions and plans, chops, dices, puts it
all into the microwave for five minutes (stirring occasionally) and then -- draws a cartoon.
<p>
My objective in this is not to produce quality software.  I do that all the time and it gets boring.  No, my objective in
this project is (1) to produce cartoons and (2) to write the Toon-o-Matic as baroquely as possible and still be able to
modify it when the muse strikes.  It works on my machine.  I don't really give a diddly damn if you can use it on yours or
not -- if you're interested in it at all, you're a penniless Web artist anyway, so figure it out yourself if you're man
enough!  (This page is sooooo liberating.  I feel better already.)  I'll even post the code.  When I get around to it,
and not a minute sooner.
<p>
Roughly, the timeline of development of the Toon-o-matic has been:
<table>
<tr><td><b>October 21, 2000</b></td><td>Panel layout</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>October 28, 2000</b></td><td>Caption layout</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>up to Nov 10 or so</b></td><td>Various panel and caption features</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>November 12, 2000</b></td><td>Rudimentary character sizing and placement</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>December 2000</b></td><td>A first stab at variant structures for characters</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>January 1, 2001</b></td><td>The first drawing commands, definition of named points for reference, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>April 2001</b></td><td>Conversion of the original much more baroque program into a single script which
outputs SVG code for ImageMagick to convert all in one fell swoop.  You don't want to know how it used to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>April 28, 2001</b></td><td>Rework of text handling to use XML font summaries generated by my new tool ttfx.
Captions again!</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In other words, this thing is really coming along.  It's got a long way to go, sure, but boy, I really didn't think I'd
stick with it even this long.  It's turning into a real pet project.  Yet to come will be dialog layout, better text
handling, lots and lots of work on character design and drawing, better panel stuff (like inset panels, etc.) -- there's
no limit.  It's great.
<p>
I'm doing all the drawing with <a href=/linkout/www.imagemagick.org>Image Magick 5.2.3</a> so far, except for text, which
I'm doing by writing little Postscript programs and running them through Ghostscript.  Ghostscript, of course, has a lot of
extremely cool graphics features, so I might get into that a lot deeper in the future.
<p>
<i>April 17, 2001</i>: now that I've upgraded to IM 5.3.1, I noticed that it understands SVG.  So now all the drawing is done
into SVG (including text) and IM then converts that into a GIF which I compress with a different tool.  I will eventually look
into the idea of using additional drawing tools to produce pieces of art which can be manipulated with SVG, and at that point
I might get back to using Postscript.  In the meantime the possible expressiveness was outweighed by the difficulty of actually
using Ghostscript in the way I was.
<p>
There are two basic modules at the moment: the first is the panel layout module, which lays out and colors the background
and all the panels.  The second is everything else, which at the moment is captions and characters.  The second is called
the layout module.  Since the first is the panel layout module, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but hey, that's
life in the big city, bub.
<p>
All this code uses some XML functionality I wrote.  This API was originally (and is still) a part of my <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/wftk.html">open-source
workflow toolkit</a> and thus a C library.  I got so used to the API, though, that I ported parts of it to Perl to use in this
and other Perl programs that I've messed with.  So to start this whole shebang off, we require that:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>require "_xmlapi";
</pre></td></tr></table>

And then we get down and do our stuff.  The panel module does panel positioning, and the layout module does the rest of the cartoon
(character placement, drawing, etc.)  Hmm.  A third module I will call the drawing module; that takes the decorated cartoon XML and
writes an SVG script for ImageMagick to work from.
