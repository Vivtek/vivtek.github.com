<strong>Twenty-first-century moment #n+2</strong>
<P>So here in Hungary, on the talk shows and news, they also have a little ticker across the bottom like CNN does. Only here, the ticker contains whatever SMS messages the viewing audience is sending to the special number on the screen.
<P>So TV, here, is a collaborative process, involving the participation of the viewing audience. How cool is that?
<P>My daughter, on hearing this, said, &quot;So could I send in, 'George Bush is stupid'?&quot; And I said, &quot;Sure.&quot; She mulled it over and said, &quot;But could they trace it back to my phone?&quot; Um, yeah. My American daughter is worried about government reprisal for expressing her political opinion. And my conclusion is that *HUNGARY* has more freedom of speech than the UNITED STATES of fricking AMERICA.
<P>What a truly odd century this is shaping up to be. TV is interactive, and freedom is something you find in Eastern Europe. Up is down, and chocolate cake is health food.

<strong>Re: Twenty-first-century moment #n+2</strong>
<P>I think it's remarkable that your daughter thought it through....what, have you been parenting or something? Impulse control! Where will it lead?!?
<P>Yesterday on the subway I watched a 5 year old rhythmicaly swinging his leg and hence kicking the middle aged secretary sitting next to him repeatedly while his father did not a darn thing.
<P>My mother would have been appalled and made me apologize.
<P>Also...Hungary has healthy chocolate cake? Why have you been withholding this paradise from me?

<strong>behold, the power of chocolate</strong>
<P>&gt; Also...Hungary has healthy chocolate cake? Why have you been withholding
<BR>> this paradise from me?
<P>chocolate has _always_ been healthy. you should read the science news. it reduces tooth decay, elevates mood, and now seems to combat insuline insensitivity. (although that is only dark chocolate - but of course, as any chocolate connoisseur knows, dark chocolate is the only _real_ chocolate)
