<strong>Penguins in Translation!</strong>
<P>It was a good movie, but what _is_ this with Vince Vaughn being suddenly in every other movie since Clay Pigeons? He's awfully miscast as Emperor Penguin in this one. If it weren't for that it would get.. well, a 4 1/2 * (cutting-room floor, people, cutting-room floor... and some wooden line-delivery.) Still gets ***.
<P>But a penguin is a penguin is a pingouin or a manchot, be he Emperor or Adelaide or Kiki.
<P>(But not pengouin. I think? Not in French, anyroad.) Recommended.
<P>Now Born into Brothels, that was ***** (or perhaps ****1/2 to be picky!) -- excellent film!..., but I'll review that some other time if someone better hasn't already...
<P>Regards! E.S.

<strong>Re: Penguins in Translation!</strong>
<P>hi eric!
<P>and (just to demonstrate my complete cultural ignorance) - there is actually a movie out called 'penguins'?
<P>i would think you were putting us on, but my brother just saw 'born into brothels' and he thought it was excellant.

<P>Hello allo! (I wasn't kidding about that part, no; it really did deserve its Oscar to my mind.) So far as I know there is no 'Penguins in Translation' to be found; there merely ought to be.
<P>I don't doubt there's a 'Penguins' on the Discovery Channel or somewhere, but I haven't seen it. IMDB does list a TV movie 'Penguins Behind Bars' from two years past. And the 1932 film 'The Penguin Pool Murder'.
<P>Now I like that title.

<P>The penguins are mere backdrop, though. Based on the book of the same name, the first of a series of mysteries featuring schoolteacher Hildegarde Withers (played in the movies by Edna May Oliver), whose students are on a field trip at the zoo, and one of whom happens to spot a corpse floating in the penguin area.

<P>Thanks!
<P>Explanation of the 'Penguins in Translation' joke... I thought there was a film with a similar name, very _very_ generally along the lines of the Being ... movies (John Malkovich etc.) There isn't.
<P>There's a book, Animals in Translation, by an author I like and have heard speak, but nowhere near so well-known as the movie I imagined would have been-- had it existed.

<P>personally, i think 'penguins behind bars' has possibilities...albeit kinky ones.
