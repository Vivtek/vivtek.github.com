<P>i have nothing against beards - i think the main reason i didn't picture you with one is that i know you have small children - my experience with people with small children is that they (the parents) tend to quickly trim off all excess hair (long hair, beards, and the more exuberant mustaches) - before they (the children) pull it all out.
<P>however, living as you do in a cold climate, i can also see the drive to keep up the insulation.

<P>Not too cold this year -- we've only had two frosts, I believe, and right now it's in the 40's and raining. Not at all normal for mid-Deciduous.

<P>btw, that's _not_ schadenfreude - that's pure demonic evil glee in the sufferings of others. (for schadenfreude, you have to feel at least a _little_ bit bad)
<P>(and _honestly_ bad, not that fakey 'oh, i'm sooooo sorry you skidded your shiny expensive behemoth suv into a ditch in all that nasty old weather')

<P>(and i actually get great amusement out of suv's coming to grief - but i'm _honest_ about it, i admit to straight out freude, no schaden about it)
<P>(btw again, babelfish seems to translate 'schade' as harm - i always thought it meant more 'pity' or 'sadness' - if, as babelfish insists, 'schadenfreude' means 'harmful joy', then, to quote emily littella, 'never mind' - and serves you right)

<P>Mm. Howard Tayler's open letter of a couple weeks back comes to mind.
<P>&gt; (not that i personally have a shiny expensive anything - just experience

<BR>> laughter)
<P>This happened to me once, in a small car, in Austria. We were going about 10 miles an hour on the Autobahn and the coefficient of friction was roughly zero. I mean *zero*. We saw up ahead how a pair of headlights originally pointing away from us were pointing towards us, then pointing up at about an 80% angle. Then we weren't facing that direction any more. We did a complete and veeeery slooooow 360. We didn't go off into the ditch but we did stop and help the other guy. He was Bosnian. They'd just started a little revolution there and he was happy to be free to go to Austria. Didn't seem to mind being in the ditch all that much, since his family was all OK. The tow truck came, then a snowplow, and we set out again, still veeeery sloooow. This was about 4 PM but it was already dark -- winter in Europe has very short days. Along about midnight we'd made it as far as Vienna (the slick road was near Salzburg, so even under really bad driving conditions we'd made a trip in eight hours that took Mozart a couple of days). The only thing that kept me going was knowing that when we got to Budapest, we'd drive from the hills out onto the Erzsebet Bridge, with the entire incredible vista of the castle, the river, Pest, the other bridges, spread out before us. We got there about 6 AM. It was foggy.
<P>...
<P>It's been four months since I travelled. I'm getting antsy. I feel the need for a road trip.
<P>&gt; (btw again, babelfish seems to translate 'schade' as harm - i always
<BR>> thought it meant more 'pity' or 'sadness' - if, as babelfish insists,
<BR>> 'schadenfreude' means 'harmful joy', then, to quote emily littella, 'never
<BR>> mind' - and serves you right)
<P>Yep. Schaden = harm. Freude = joy. Schadenfreude = joy in witnessing harm to others. At least in German. I take it the English usage is somewhat less nasty. I'd never heard it in English before I learned German, so I can't help you much on this one, mouse.
<P>(This reminds me of the time a guy wanted to tell me a joke; he asked me, &quot;What's German for constipation?&quot; -- The joke answer is of course &quot;Far from poopin&quot;, like &quot;Fahrvergnuegen&quot;, which dates the joke to the early 90's of course. So with no perceptible pause at all, of course, I answered, &quot;Verstopfung.&quot; And wondered why he wanted to know *that*.)

<P>&gt; Mm. Howard Tayler's open letter of a couple weeks back comes to mind.
<P>(yeah, i saw that too - _love_ his image of the taillights flashing &quot;i'm such an idiot&quot;)
<P>&gt; Yep. Schaden = harm. Freude = joy. Schadenfreude = joy in witnessing harm
<BR>> to others. At least in German.
<P>see, my memory of this is learning german in high school. we started out learning social phrases - &quot;guten morgen&quot; &quot;wie geht es ihr&quot;, etc. can't remember exactly the sequence of what we were learning - but at one point (with truly no unkind intent, just some sort of uncertainly wired rote response thing), the entire class responded to the teacher's &quot;es geht mir gut&quot; with &quot;schade&quot; (fortunately her response to this was to bust up laughing)
<P>now that i am home and have dug out my cassell's, i find that 'schade' does mean 'pity' (altho in the sense of 'what a pity!'); 'schaden' (as i am sure you will hasten to point out) is a whole different word (altho listed under 'schade') meaning 'harm or hurt'; 'schadenfreude' is defined as 'malicious pleasure or gloating' which corresponds well to webster's &quot;enjoyment obtained from other's troubles&quot; (altho the german does give one more a sense of delightful wickedness). i suspect now that my personal definition of 'schadenfreude' (which i seem to have defined as a sort of bittersweet joy) has to do with my memories of 'schade', and my ignorance of 'schaden' (and my reader's habit of guessing at the meaning of words i don't know) - so i am glad to learn the correct meaning (it also means some of eric's posts now make more sense)
<P>ok, i accede to your emotion.
<P>(but you gotta admit, babelfish is a trifle off).

<BR>> does mean 'pity' (altho in the sense of 'what a pity!');
<P>Well (and now you've awakened my pedantic side) the &quot;definitions&quot; given in two-language dictionaries aren't &quot;meanings&quot; -- they're usages. The word &quot;Schade&quot; is an obsolete form of the nominative &quot;Schaden&quot;, and &quot;schade&quot; is an adjectival form of the same word. As an adjective it can't really be said to correspond to English &quot;harm&quot; very well, because &quot;harm&quot; doesn't even *have* a direct adjectival form, but rather participates in constructions like &quot;harmful&quot; (which would be &quot;schaedlich&quot; in German.)
<P>So &quot;schade&quot; is an adjective which is used in the same kinds of situations as in English we'd use the noun &quot;a pity&quot; -- which doesn't mean the same thing as &quot;pity&quot;, after all.
<P>The way words in different languages are used can vary wildly. I think that's really neat. It's why attempts to compile multilingual lexica for computer use are doomed to utter failure. You often simply can't encode any meaning which has a single word for it in several languages at once. If I'm given English &quot;wall&quot; without enough context, I don't know whether it should be translated to German &quot;Wand&quot; (inside wall) or &quot;Mauer&quot; (outside wall) -- a German would be tempted to think we use the word &quot;wall&quot; sloppily to mean both types of wall, but in reality we don't even think of different types of wall. They're just all walls.
<P>OK, I'm done now.
<P>&gt; (but you gotta admit, babelfish is a trifle off).
<P>That's why Babelfish is a perennial source of humor.

<P>it _is_ pretty cool - i took one semester of russian, which was a real eye-opener, because it really has no similarities to english (unlike german and french, which, while different, do show evidence of being related) -- which gets one started on thinking about how much language does control what one can think, and makes you amazed that people of different languages manage to understand each other at all.

<strong>re: itchy feet</strong>
<P>just came across this - doubtless you should include it on your next itinerary:
<P>&quot;Stalin World&quot; - http://www.travel-lithuania.com/grutas/
<P>i absolutely have to quote the text: &quot;In 1998, Public Organisation HESONOS KLUBAS (Hesonos club) won the tender of Lithuanian Ministery of Culture to establish centralized exposiotion of Soviet time sculptures in nature. In 1999, demontated soviet time sculptures from LIthuanian cities were brought to Grutas.
<P>The number of ideological sculptures in one exposition is very rare and unique even in world context. It is heritage of several decades of Lithuanian monumental art, despite it's ideological content. These symbols of Lithuanian nation tragical time period enclose truph about soviet occupation times to us and especially to our children.&quot;

<P>There's a similar free-air museum in Budapest, or more accurately, near Budapest. We visited year before last after my constant badgering forced my wife and her family to take action. It was quite impressive, and included one of the statues I most loved. (Along with the rest of the socialist-period art, it had vanished. I found out why it had been located where it was: it was erected on top of the cornerstone of one of the largest cathedrals in Budapest, which the Party had demolished shortly after taking power....)
