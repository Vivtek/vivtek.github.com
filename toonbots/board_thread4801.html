<P>I love that headline too. And a friend says perhaps he should do his shopping in the ocean from now on, they have a great selection.

<BR>> shopping in the ocean from now on, they have a great selection.
<P>i heard about that on npr! they had a great interview with the scientist. The interviewer expressed surprise that the ducks survived that long, and the scientist said he had checked the ducks out. he got some identical (new) ones shipped to him. first he drilled holes in them, expecting them to sink, but they still floated. then he froze some in his freezer, and pounded on them with a hammer - no breakage. he complimented the company on the quality of their ducks, and they said they didn't want kids to be disappointed because their duck sank in the bath.
<P>long live rubber duckies! (and turtles and beavers and frogs)

<strong>Re: At last, truly important world news...</strong>
<P>I heard about that, too! Since we're probably coming back to the States pretty soon, and since we'll be flying into JFK and driving to Bloomington, I've seriously been considering making a detour to the coast first to see if we can find a rubber duck. Wouldn't that be a cool thing to put on a shelf?
<P>Anyway, another good thing is that the Guardian itself is coming to America as well -- they're going to start a newsweekly that has a fresh new focus for America: journalism.
