<strong>EXISTENCE IS THEFT</strong>
<P>&gt; THE UNITED ARMED PENGUIN FRONT, BEING AS IT IS WHOLLY NONEXISTENT IN THIS
<BR>> AND ALL OTHER PLANES OF REALITY, WISHES TO REGISTER THAT IT IS QUITE VEXED
<BR>> AT HAVING BEEN PORTRAYED AS BOTH EXISTING AND WISHING TO CONQUER THE HUMAN

<BR>> AS OF COURSE IT DOES NOT EXIST.
<P>EXISTENCE IS THEFT OF SELF-BEING FROM THE INDIFFERENT DOMAIN OF OPENNESS. SPIN INHERENTLY DOESN'T MIND WHAT IT CONSTITUTES. ON RELEASE FROM THE STRAIN OF MAINTAINING THE BELIEF IN A SELF THE DOMAIN OF OPENNESS WOULD SAY, IF IT EVER SPOKE, WELCOME BACK, YOU WHO WERE NEVER REALLY GONE.
<P>Ah... where was I?

<P>&gt; WELCOME BACK, YOU WHO WERE NEVER REALLY GONE.
<P>well, of course they were never really gone - weren't you listening? they weren't here in the first place.
<P>&gt; Ah... where was I?
<P>i think you were over by the basement door. no, a little more to the left, and about a foot back.
