<strong>Wow.</strong>
<P>Now that I've slept, I can see that yesterday's steady Pokey the Penguin diet seems to have affected my brain when I slapped out the strip. That's just not healthy.
<P>Did anybody like that?

<P>*mutters about WebBBS's inability to handle HTML code, without which that looks merely strange instead of strange and Pokeyish. IT IS A LEARNING CURVE*

<strong>Re: Wow.</strong>
<P>Well, nice to see more of Mao. Actually, I though the strip itself seemed fairly typical of Toonbots, and actually made more sense than some. It wasn't until I saw the blurb that I wondered what was going on.
<P>I'd heard of &quot;Pokey the Penguin,&quot; usually described in unflatterring terms, but never really looked at it. At first I thought either Michael had been working too hard, or the Bot had taken over writing the descriptions. I took a brief look at &quot;Pokey&quot; (a few strips, not the whole archive) and while its not the sort of thing I'd read regularly, it certainly had its moments, and I might possibly check back on it from time to time. I can't help but wonder what Arctic Circle Candy tastes like, though.
<P>Three Toonbots in one week. Very nice indeed.

<P>I'm trying to pick up the pace a little. Given that a Toonbots that doesn't require new functionality really doesn't take much time to write, I don't have a lot of excuse to let things slide.

<P>...
<P>Is that rhetorical?
<P>Don't worry, my deep end goes way down; I figure I've only lost about 30% of full sanity. Of course, you still don't know how full the tanks were to start with! VUY GOVORITE GUN!!! NYET! Captain! Sanity at 60%! Another hit like that and the dilithium crystals can't take it! Shut ... up, Scotty. Step ... on the ... gas, Sulu.

<P>I'm finally finishing the Pokey the Penguin archives, thanks to your wonderful review of it. And I'm doing it in three sittings, not one. :P
<P>Urgh. My brainpan feels fairly fried after all that posting... And if I'm estimating right, I'm only halfway to catching up with Emsworth again. *sigh*
