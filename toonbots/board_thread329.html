<strong>'Toonbots: [INSERT SLOGAN HERE.]'</strong>
<P>This conversation happened approximately three minutes ago in the strange little land wherein weirdos have been known to hang. It's a Choose Your Own Slogan Spectacular!
<P>---
<P>Jenny says, &quot;'Toonbots: it's like a pay phone.'&quot;
<P>Chris says, &quot;'Toonbots: I've never understood you people either.'&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;'Toonbots: because most of us don't have doors.'&quot;
<P>Chris says, &quot;'Toonbots: we don't need no stinkin' artists.'&quot;
<P>Chris says, &quot;'Toonbots: The difference between an orange.'&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;'Toonbots: now with Jihad.'&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;That one could stand some rewording, I think, actually.&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;'Toonbots: dot, bot, dot, bot, dot, bot, fun!'&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;'Fun!' could also be 'Yay!' or 'Whee!' if you like.&quot;
<P>Chris says, &quot;'Toonbots: Giving Patrick Shaughnessy a run for his money.'&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;'Toonbots: the reason for Perl's existence.'&quot;
<P>Chris says, &quot;'Toonbots: the reason for YOUR existence.'&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;'Toonbots: more fun than picking glass out of your eyes for three weeks.'&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;That one's a bit of a niche slogan.&quot;
<P>Chris says, &quot;&quot;'Toonbots: Where do you want to go today?' You have to be cool to get the humor.&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;Any more before I post this on the Toonbots board? ;)&quot;
<P>Chris says, &quot;'Toonbots: Too cool for Keenspot.'&quot;
<P>Jenny says, &quot;Spoony yeah!&quot;
<P>---
<P>Thank you.

<P>Um... Napoleon made me post it... not that it matters now, I've been killed so much I'm dead even in the afterlife, thank you all very much...

<strong>Re: 'Toonbots: [INSERT SLOGAN HERE.]'</strong>
<P>&gt; Toonbots: One out of several gophers recommend Toonbots
<P>I've always wondered what sort of person takes on the name gopher. In my case, it was forced upon me by several people so that I could serve as a complement to another person's nickname of &quot;Blue Gay Bunny&quot; (I'm pretty sure drugs were involved with that one. I wasn't there, however, so can't say for sure). Soon, a few people started calling me &quot;gopher&quot; on a regular basis, and it stuck. Since I doubt a situation like this happens to the average person, why are there other gopher's out there? Do they just really like &quot;Caddyshack&quot;?
<P>Hm. I should probably get some rest too.

<P>I like Caddyshack. It's funny. As for your slogan here's my shot. toonbots: Ummmm..... hmmmm..... ahhhh..... Maybe..... no that won't work.... okay..... If you like.... no... that's dumb.......... I forget what I was...... oh wait..... no.... Nevermind.

<P>&gt; Hope no
<BR>> one minds if I try my hand at it:
<P>This is great! On Dec. 1 and 2, I got to read Toonbots without writing it myself, and today, people are writing my website for me! Wow!
<P>&gt; Toonbots: Boontots
<P>Or Toobnots, or Totnoobs, etc.
<P>&gt; Toonbots: Over half a dozen readers can't be wrong
<P>Hahahahaha.... This one I really liked!

<strong>Wow. I'm touched.</strong>
<P>I'm touched, and you're all a little tetched. I still have troubles believing that people actually read this strip. But to come up with Zingers... !!! *&amp;^@#*$% and other line noise!
<P>I'm going to have to put together a slogan rotator now, so a different slogan comes up on every hit. That'll be cool, and obviously I have a whole lotta slogans ready to go!
<P>Toonbots: now with Jihad!

<strong>Re: Wow. I'm touched.</strong>
<P>Here's some more!
<P>Toonbots: hey, this thing took fifteen minutes to create (ten of those minutes being in the background while the meta-cartoonist was doing billable work in the foreground), the least you could do is devote your entire existence to it!
<P>Toonbots: like you have anything better to do.
<P>Toonbots: look, how many times do I have to tell you?! Just READ the thing!
<P>Toonbots: the bounding boxes that shape your world.
<P>Toonbots: meta-cartooning at its meta-finest.
<P>This is fun.
