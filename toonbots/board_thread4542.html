<strong>Gooooood Morning, Toonbots Jihad!</strong>
<P>I have the archives working again! It only took me a week's work! (But they're working on brand spanking new code, code which will now be usable for Emsworth's space at Toonjunkies, which is all told a Good Thing.)
<P>Soon I will even have time to take up the reins of metacartooning once more, and Life will be Grand.

<P>archives is back. i yam happy. (the xml muddle seems (1) blockquote related, with misnesting and repeats, (2) i noticed [[generic filler]] didn't appear (for lack of quoting?). oh, and today's previous and next links are confunded.) it was good to see again all the layers of toonbots confusion, and practise my nakht.
<P>yes, a good christmas eve singing at our UU church, and a good christmas day with family and friends three towns north. we had some snow falling on our return, now mostly melted in the new year's eve fog.

<strong>Re: Gooooood Morning, Toonbots Jihad!</strong>
<P>&gt; yay, michael! yay, archives! yay, toonjunkies!
<BR>>
<BR>> so did everybody have a good christmas?
<P>Indeed. Another year has begun, and I again find myself a year older. It is an exasperating trend, but one you grow used to. My world spins on as it ever has, with nothing of import to interrupt my growing ennui.
<P>On the other hand, my sister came home for Christmas Eve, which was nice despite the vomiting. Also, I got not one, but two books of ancient chinese military strategy/philosophy, those being &quot;Mastering the Art of War&quot; and &quot;The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China.&quot; This has served to noticeably brighten up my days, as there is nothing like reading about how to slaughter large numbers of people while looking very honorable and intellectual to improve one's mood, and this has been rather a long sentence, hasn't it.
<P>In any case, I suppose my self-indulgent musings must end here, both because this quesion was more than likely not directed at irresponsible vagabonds such as I, and because I have run out of things to say. Until next purpose and volition cross paths in my mind.
<P>Patrick Burroughs

<P>no, no, it was an open question....and clearly running out of things to say has never stopped _me_.
<P>of course, now i will be kept up nights worrying about the possible effects of the interaction of your growing ennui with your equally growing collection of books on military strategy......

<P>You should *really* be worried about the possibility that I will try to combine all of the aforementioned elements. There is nothing I enjoy more than a good synchresis.
