<P>It can be rather hard to maintain the level of posting quality that this message board requires, so perhaps is it better not to post for a little while than to destroy the value of all the posts as a whole by posting something that isn't quite as coherent, like this sentence, which is being posted without the help of caffeine.
<P>There, all new post just for you Napoleon. Now I gotta go fix that caffeine problem...

<BR>> message board requires,
<P>OK. So, *I'm sorry* that I made fun of your syntax. Can we move on now?
<P>Napoleon, I think we're just mourning dear departed Emsworth. But *snif* life goes on.
<P>I went caving today, thank you. Well. Not &quot;caving&quot;, I just went on a guided tour at Marengo Cave (which has among other things Indiana's largest cave passage, and actually since they discovered the third level five years ago I think it's Indiana's largest cave system period. Not sure of that last.) It's a convenient way to do something outdoorsy when it's cold.
<P>Not like we haven't seen every public cave in Indiana more than once, but it's still a fun Saturday thing.
<P>I'm going to do an episode now. I've let things slide too long again. I didn't like the last one much and this French Riviera thing pretty much made me forget everything else.

<P>I'm sorry! I had just woken up, and I really wasn't thinking incredibly clearly. Never again will I wander the halls of the 'toon before partaking of the holy caffeine.

<P>Oh, yeah? Well SOME of us don't NEED caffeine to clear our thoughts! We get by on plain ol' insanity! Mostly 'cause caffeine gives us tummyaches and then we're in pain all the rest of the day.

<P>I don't like those sci-fi cloning things when they happen. Cause there's always someone there with a gun. And he can't figure out which is the evil clone and which is the good original. Well this time I'll be the one with the gun. And I deem both clone and original to be evil. Say good bye. ::shoots both Napoleons:: Problem solved! Everyone go home.
