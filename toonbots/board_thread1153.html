<strong>Toonbots Propaganda</strong>
<P>Sigh. Well, I haven't gotten far with a jihad charter (will probably have to wait on that.) I'd been hoping to do some propoganda posters as well. I finished the first one, of Gopher, a couple days ago, though I've been worrying about the caption. I finally just slapped one on. Frankly, though, I doubt if it's the sort of thing Goebbels would have done. Doesn't really register, you know. I may simply abandon the whole idea. Still, here's a link to the thing
<P>Apparently one can embed images now, judging by a couple recent posts; however, as I'm not sure if it's a simple matter of using image tags or something else, and as this board does not allow for much in the way of trial and error, here's the link: <img src=http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/blandings5/propoganda1.jpg>

<P>Hmm. I think I like this propanganda idea. I always liked socialist-period art. It's so ... massive.
<P>Budapest has a great statuary museum. When they ripped all the stars off things and removed the various Russian soldiers and stuff, some extremely foresighted people decided that instead of melting it all down, they should put it all into a big field outside the city. If you're ever in Budapest, I highly recommend it. I love the place. One in particular is my favorite statue of all times; I wish I could find the picture to scan... Hmm. I'll have to find a website for the museum. It has to have one. The Hungarians are rabid Internet adopters. This particular statue, though, is a squarely-built peasant running with a big cloth or something in his hand, obviously a revolutionary. He used to stand right next to the Varosfold (city park, effectively), near Hero's Place (yeah, that's really the name.) After he was gone, I found out why. He was on top of the cornerstone of a cathedral that the Communists destroyed.
<P>So. Sordid history, but damned good art. I still like the statue, and the reason for its existence just gives the right amount of chill. I think we can all be happy that Stalinism is (mostly) in the past, unless you're North Korean, in which case I wish you a happy Hanukkah.
<P>I think I lost track there for a moment. But I'm back now. I like the propaganda angle. I'm going to have to do a little font research, but I think the Toon-o-Matic could be persuaded to do posters with a little rewiring and a swift kick or two.
