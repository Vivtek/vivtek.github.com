<strong>5 posts...</strong>
<P>I just wanted to share my shock that the cursed thread reaper has knocked me down to 5 posts. FIVE posts. Oh, woe is me. Mouse, OTOH, has 25 times as many. Not to reopen THAT can of worms, its just a sign of how severely untoonbotty my life has been lately. The last 5 weeks have been a massive rush to complete a project due today (and finished, thank you, with ALL of the promised features and 40% of the &quot;we'll try damn hard to put that in too&quot; features).
<P>FIVE posts.

<P>&gt; Not to reopen THAT can of worms
<P>mille grazie - (i was mostly just chattering so the place wouldn't be so quiet)
<P>&gt; a project due today (and finished, thank you, with ALL of
<BR>> the promised features and 40% of the &quot;we'll try damn hard to put that
<BR>> in too&quot; features).
<P>congratulations! - that much work excuses a brief absence.
<P>[altho speaking as someone who was once in business - you realize if you make a habit of giving your customers what they want, on time, _with_ _extras_, they'll just get all spoiled and surly. (this is the problem with doing things well - people start assuming it can't be all _that_ hard, really)]
<P>BUT - congratulations anyway!
<P>

<P>Well, this is so that they'll BECOME customers. And pay us. This was all a promo, called an IDP or &quot;initial demonstration of prototype&quot;, meaning we can DO IT IF YOU PAY US! (Please pay us!). Once they're customers we'll slack off and manage help desk calls ;)

<P>Tirdun's back! Tirdun's back!
<P>Tirdun used to /dominate/ the board, when I first started. He was...like...umm...some big wrestler guy who was...ummm...all over the mat. (There's probably cool terminology for that concept but wrasslin' isn't my strong suit)
<P>&gt; Once they're customers we'll slack off and manage help desk calls ;)
<P>You know, it's the strong work ethic that makes America great. If it weren't for (&quot;Ummm...Jenn? Aren't you the one who spends her entire work day reading comics and posting on the forum?&quot; &quot;What's yer point?&quot;)
<P>Tirdun's back! Tirdun's back!

<BR>> Tirdun used to /dominate/ the board, when I first started.
<P>Y'know, it hasn't been THAT long. And I don't know if I'm BACK as much as I've got a temporary break. Once the customer says &quot;GO&quot; we're back in up to our collective eyeballs.
<P>Osama made me laugh out loud, BTW. Waiting anxiously for the meta code to build a face using parts. Heh-heh.

<P>Thppfffft. Nobody ever said that writing software to implement cartoons would be easy. And it's not like there's any money in it. I haven't actually done any Toon-o-Matic development since April.
<P>But I'm not *done* yet -- I'll never be done.

<P>which is why it's an art -- the process is as least as important as the outcome.
<P>what can i say - a man on a quest is irresistable.
<P>(unfortunately, so is a cheap shot)
