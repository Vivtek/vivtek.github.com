<strong>Talk about your red hot blather!</strong>
<P>In the tradition of me telling folks about things that they just don't need to know...
<P>They cut my hours by half at work. This significantly increases the amount of time I'll be staring at my computer screen. Guess what that means?
<P>No. I am not volunteering to deworm the wolverines. No, it's not my turn. No, I know we didn't draw my name out of a hat.
<P>In other news, the Wall of Tacky Jesi has been recently reinstalled in my home. We have: that holographic Jesus where if you lean just right, he looks like he has nicotining (or whatever) eyelids. A clock of the last supper that also lights up different colors. A shepherd Jesus that lights up red and flashes. A chinese Jesus that you hang in your car and says 'Drive safely!' in Chinese. A pope bottle opener (The pope opens my brews!), also known as the pope-ener. And all the action figures. People tend to buy them for you, once they see the wall.
<P>

<strong>Re: Whoah, I have a drop down box for subjects now</strong>
<P>&gt; i thought she was hungarian? oh....closeness of all the irritating
<BR>> relatives?
<P>In her case, you can imagine the entire nation of Hungary to be the irritating relatives. All 10 million of them. She keeps coming up with new examples of why they're horrible, and gets really irritated when the kids and I laugh.
<P>Case in point: her school friend, with whom we're staying, has a 14-year-old son just now going into high school, and he had a book from the government with, you know, career &quot;advice&quot;. I try to explain to my wife that the combination of guidance counselors and a federal bureaucracy would result in incredible inanity in any country -- can you imagine the hash the US would make of it? -- but she read a few examples from the book of things which should exclude people from particular career decisions. The one she really went off on was skin blemishes, which the book says should be reason not to consider any job working with people, like sales, daycare, beauty salons, etc. My wife nearly went incandescent on that one, while my daughter laughed herself sick at the book. I mean, there's really no way to look at stuff like that except as humor.
<P>Then she read the ones for colorblindness (full disclosure: I'm colorblind.) Careers colorblind people shouldn't consider include electrical engineering (did I mention I'm an electrical engineer by training?), truck driving, art, shoemaking (this one really got a laugh from the peanut gallery), and so on.
<P>So anyway, this was evidence for her of the incredibly low cultural level attained by her pathetic nation. But it's the air pollution that really has her incensed. It's truly horrible, and apparently getting worse, not better, as people buy more cars and then sit in traffic jams around the city for hours a day. (Not exaggerating on this one, either.) Budapest is the dirtiest city in Europe. According to official statistics, I mean. Of course, the fact that it is in fact a &quot;city in Europe&quot;, i.e. the Union, is new enough that the Euro environmental directives haven't taken force. Yet. They will soon enough, though, at which point things *will* change.
<P>But in the meantime, the air here reeks.
<P>Interestingly, there's an incredible amount of money pouring into the city. You see it everywhere, new construction, renovation, it's really coming up to Euro standard. Prices are lagging, thank God; food is still affordable, and rents somewhat lower than we're used to paying.
<P>Here's one idea we've had: there are a few houses listed online with prices under $10,000. Not in the city, of course, but out in the provinces. I'm seriously considering buying a house with cash. In ten years it'll be worth ten times as much.
<P>Romania and Bulgaria are also places where people are buying up real estate. Romania is joining the Union in January, 2007. Stuff is still really cheap.
<P>Anyhoo. That's the scoop at the moment.

<P>(i'm determined to work on my subjecting)
<P>having spent a few years of my youth in the LA smog basin (and not even the worst part of it) i sympathize entirely with your wife. i distinctly remember how upset i was when it looked like we might move to san bernadino - which at that time had several smog alerts a week. i'm sure the air will improve...eventually. i for one wouldn't care to wait around.
<P>but i like the idea of buying a house for cash. and if it is out of town, this means it is in the country...so you can refer to it as your country estate. that would be even better.

<P>a) Jenn is not so special that she rides the short bus to school. b) Jenn has had a hard time finding things other than hunger that will make her hallucinate since leaving school (and consequently the short bus) behind. c) We use linux. Go at it, smart people. Would that do it?

<P>You guys are very bold to put your emails up there for everyone to see, I have to say. I was beaten out of the habit by the little man, when right after I started putting up my fake email addresses, 'littleplasticpenguinsATplasticspork.com' was immediately innundated with spam emails that were very concerned about littleplasticpenguin's ability to find good farmland based pornography or a good mortgage.

<P>Well, you'll be happy to know, at least in that respect, that it won't cut into my time at all. In as much as I'm not going this year. Delayed yet again, no funding (one person ahead of me for Syracuse had backed out, but then *her* funding at Georgetown fell through, so this poor doggy [or wolverine keeper] got none). The plus side is it leave me unfettered, apart from needing a job and source of income (I'm actually looking into possibly getting a gig or two from Egmont, Disney's European comics arm, so we'll see how that pans out), so I can have more time to look at other grad schools, go to cons, etc. Jenn, if I do visit Syracuse, depending on time, we may well look into meeting up with you somewhere in NYC (especially if the Fiddler revival is still on Broadway; my dad and I love that show).

<P>The spring is pretty chilly, but the house is basically finished except for the floor coverings, trim, and inspection. It's the third that makes it illegal to move in. But &quot;illegal&quot; in Hungary is kind of a vague thing.
<P>The apartment is perfect. Concrete, tile, and hardwood floors (for allergy management), two bedrooms plus a huge workroom in the attic space with a big window and (soon) broadband, ha, city-owned forested areas nearby but not close enough to mean it'll be damp, and low rent relative to both Indiana and Puerto Rico.
