<strong>Jan. 7 spoiler (Oranges and Graphic Design!)</strong>
<P>Sigh, I've spent far too much time this week checking back to see if the Toon-o-Matic has accomplished anything (though I suppose it's helping your hits, Michael. I've been wondering, anyway, what are your numbers like? On average, about a dozen or less per day as might be indicated by forum traffic and comments elsewhere, or are there other Toonbots readers, who are just too busy, lazy, or afraid to admit the fact on the message board? I know I can't help but feel that my own evangelistic efforts have been ignored, for the most part. Perhaps I'm just not going to the right forums.) I also wish I could get that trippy &quot;Oranges&quot; song out of my head.
<P>Anyway, today's Toonbot was excellent. Glad to see BoxJam has his eye back (and is taking inventory, even). Seeing BoxJam wink in the third panel was quite unexpected. However, the grand denoument, with the vengeful meta-cartoonist making BoxJam orange, was brilliant! Also, the blurb was probably the most directly related to the strip thus far. At the current rate of technical davncement, though, it may not be too long before the Toon-O-Matic can handle VegeMellowHead! Perhaps in a few months it might be able to add background props (like, say, windows or boats.)

<strong>Still drawing!</strong>
<P>&gt; Sigh, I've spent far too much time this week checking back to see if the

<P>Yeah, me, too. That Michael is such a slacker.
<P>&gt; (though I suppose it's helping your
<BR>> hits, Michael.
<P>If I cared. No ads. No hosting company. Just me and my server.
<P>&gt; I've been wondering, anyway, what are your numbers like?
<P>Oh, 20 or 30 hits to the home page a day. Not sure how many uniques; I haven't looked that closely. I don't think Toonbots is really all that appropriate for the unwashed masses.
<P>&gt; I know I can't help but feel that my own evangelistic efforts have been
<BR>> ignored, for the most part.
<P>Well, some is cool and some is ain't.
<P>&gt; Anyway, today's Toonbot was excellent.
<P>Thenk yew.
<P>&gt; Also, the blurb was
<BR>> probably the most directly related to the strip thus far.
<P>Yes, I'm slipping.
<P>&gt; At the current
<BR>> rate of technical davncement, though, it may not be too long before the
<BR>> Toon-O-Matic can handle VegeMellowHead! Perhaps in a few months it might
<BR>> be able to add background props (like, say, windows or boats.)
<P>That's kind of my hope, yes. It's going to be a long time before it gets to the point where a character could sit in a boat and be concealed by the side of the boat. I'm really not even thinking that far ahead, just worrying about purely two-dimensional layout at this point.
<P>A window, on the other hand, would be relatively simple. Nice idea. Brings defenestration to mind.
<P>VegeMellowHead... I'm not sure. Mallethead is really pretty complicated in a geometrical sense, and basically, even though the seeds are hopefully starting to be there for a more cognitive and less geometrical model for the Toon-o-Matic, we're still pretty constrained by the low-level geometry.
<P>You might see Horse before you see VegeMellowHead. Or PVP-like characters. BoxJam's only there because his style doesn't get too damaged when you geometrize it, but I think Mallethead would probably just not work very well.

<strong>Oops!</strong>
<P>
<BR>>I don't think Toonbots is really all that appropriate for the unwashed masses.
<P>Just as well, perhaps. They'd probably give off an odor.
<P>&gt; A window, on the other hand, would be relatively simple. Nice idea. Brings
<BR>> defenestration to mind.
<P>Perhaps it might even be possible before May. Might be nice to have the Toon-O-Matic do a special strip to commemorate May 23, the 383rd anniversary of the Defenestration of Prague.
<P>And apologies. I went away from the computer for awhile, suddenly noticed that the screen hadn't changed and my message was still there, and assumed that I had forgotten to send it, thus re-posting the original message. Don't suppose it can be deleted?

<P>Wait, wait. Is this a real event? Then we have to have a special edition, yes. I mean, that just has to happen.

<P>Oh yes, the Defenestration of Prague really happened. It's what started the Thirty Years' War. I never knew the actual day of the year that it happened, though... just two days before my birthday, and four before Napoleon's. Strange, that.

<P>Y'know, not to sound arrogant, but I'm unused to other people knowing things that I don't. It's disconcerting.
<P>OK. So. May 23rd will be a red-letter day here at Toonbots. That's settled. The 383rd anniversary of the Defenestration of Prague.
<P>What I can't figure out is how they managed to get a whole *city* through the window. Wow. They must have had to rebuild the whole place afterwards.

<P>I think you may have the wrong impression. The incident took place in Prague, hence the name. However, all that happened was that, roughly (some of my sources varied slightly) on May 23, 1618, a group of Protestant revolutionaries stormed the palace of the king of Bohemia (who was very much a Catholic) and threw two priests out of a window. This act signaled the beginning of a national Protestant uprising, and also, as Chris said, started the Thirty Year's War.
<P>However, your interpretation of events might be more entertaining.

<P>I like the whole-city-out-the-window version better. But then, I would.
