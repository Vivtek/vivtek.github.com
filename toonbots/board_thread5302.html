<strong>I done did it</strong>
<P>I'm now living in Ponce, Puerto Rico. So far, I love it. The apartment is great, the weather is great, the people are friendly, and my boy is less allergic (not 100%, but close) even though we've taken him off all his meds.
<P>I think this may have been a good move.

<P>glad to hear it!
<P>...so does this mean we can look forward to brightly colored, sunny (and hypoallergenic) toonbots?

<P>As soon as the pent-up work pile gets a little less horrible, then -- may be. May very well be. And the good news is that I'm close to finishing one long-running project. And since I don't have to work on that stupid house and yard any more -- well, things may be looking up.
<P>

<P>be careful about that looking up when you are working at the beach. seagulls, you know.
<P>(and congratulations on finishing the project! ... notice how i am carefully not pointing out that we are moving into the heavy campaigning season. or are you managing to avoid all news in p.r.? if so, can i come live with you?)

<BR>> seagulls, you know.
<P>Laptops and salt spray don't mix -- I don't envision myself working anywhere near a beach.
<P>&gt; (and congratulations on finishing the project!
<P>Not 100% done -- but damned close.
<P>&gt; ... notice how i am
<BR>> carefully not pointing out that we are moving into the heavy campaigning
<BR>> season. or are you managing to avoid all news in p.r.?
<P>Pretty much, yeah. It's amazing how much further away it all feels from here. And that's a Good Thing. I'm still reading some of the blogs, but I don't care as much. And I'm not watching any news on TV at all. Since I got cable Internet, I also got cable. Meaning that the TV is much better utilized on Cartoon Network. (Getting cable may prove to have been a mistake. My kids are glued to it.)
<P>&gt; if so, can i come
<BR>> live with you?
<P>We have an extra room. Can you cook?
