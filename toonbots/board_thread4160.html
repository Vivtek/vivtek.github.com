<strong>hey tirdun!</strong>
<P>i was going to post something on your board, but keenspace is refusing to recognize me. just wanted to say, hope things get better for you. sorry you're giving up faraway stars (i've only been reading it a few months, so still a bit lost on the plot - but the premise was interesting) - but the rest of life is definitely more important. hope you can continue your job - but you know, if things are really uncertain, i would say don't worry about looking for something else - you posted something before about not being able to give prospective employers a start date, because you didn't know when/if the old job was going away. unless you truly, truly love the job you have, and want to keep it at all costs, don't worry about quitting it. if your employer can't guarantee continued employment, they can't expect you to guarantee that you'll just hang around waiting for the ax to fall. better to move on, and remove the stress. (the best time to job hunt is _always_ while you still have a job)

<strong>hey mouse!</strong>
<P>&gt; i was going to post something on your board, but keenspace is refusing to
<BR>> recognize me. just wanted to say, hope things get better for you.
<P>Things aren't as awful right now, and the job situation is ok for a bit longer (September). In fact, I may get final approval for a year-long position soon, if things work out.
<P>&gt; sorry you're giving up faraway stars
<P>Me too. I haven't had the heart to continue. I was very disappointed in the last few months worth of work. It was getting confusing for me (and I have lots of notes) and I was losing track of the simple story that I started with. Every time I'd start a new issue, I'd give up and later delete it. Got to be depressing, so I stopped.
<P>&gt; if your employer can't guarantee continued employment, they can't
<BR>> expect you to guarantee that you'll just hang around waiting for the ax to
<BR>> fall.
<P>The company has actually been supportive, helping me look inside the company and outside at other companies for jobs. The problem has been the market in my area, I live in a fairly rural section near a Navy base, so all the jobs surround the base and the market has been ugly lately. The other issue is all the stuff I've built up here, vacation, 401K, sick leave, seniority, etc.
<P>Anyway, I'm still around, still checking the toonbots board and working on other stuff. Maybe I'll start another comic... maybe I'll redo FS. I don't know... Thanks for thinking of me.
