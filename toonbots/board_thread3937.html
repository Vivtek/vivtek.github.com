<strong>Loyalty</strong>
<P>Sigh: http://snaildust.xidus.net/archives/archive.php3?day=01252002
<P>No mention of Despammed.com, provided as always free of charge by your humble metatoonist. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
<P>But what really disturbs me? How long it's been since I read Snail Dust. So loyalty's lack cuts both ways. Sorry, Napoleon.

<P>and of course, appreciated. my problem is with existing e-mail: i.e., my work e-mail, which address i must keep - and which is now getting promos for things like dvd burners (i had thought the u. had filters to keep such things out). of course the problem there is, a lot of the 'spam' comes from 1) the university (got like 3 notices in the last week reminding us of the university anti-harassment policies) or 2) from software companies with whom we have a license, sending me notices of courses which are always on the other side of the country and cost like $4000 (academic rates!) - unfortunately, i can't black them out entirely because sometimes we actually have legitimate business. *sigh*
<P>i am considering changing my home e-mail though (juno is making me crazy) - however. just checked out despammed.com, and my confidence is somewhat undermined, because pages 2, 3 and the &quot;Here's how&quot; link all seem to go to the same page......

<P>Problems with their website set-up aside, I've found it to be quite useful as a filter. Never received any spam addressed to the despammed address, and actually wound up deleting my old AOL account and setting up a new one just for Despammed to redirect mail to. Seems to be working perfectly thus far.

<P>this is what i am considering doing. i signed up for juno for home use (because it is free), but it has an outrageous amount of advertising, so i am thinking of switching anyway, and considering setting up a despammed account at the same time. so did you start with a despammed account forwarding to your original e-mail address? could you detect if you were getting all the stuff you should have? i don't know if you do any ordering on-line - i do, and the company will send e-mail confirmation of the order, and of shipping (which i want) but then also sends endless ads (which i don't want) - must admit i haven't paid enough attention to headers to know if there are detectable differences.
<P>spamcop (i take it from the cartoon) is a way of dealing with already received spam - does it then go back and kill the sender?

<P>You could kill two birds with one stone and sign up with MyGuard.net, a dialup service which uses despammed filtration.
<P>As to the site: a friend did free layout for me a ways back. I liked the layout, so he uploaded it to the site before I fixed some of it. The tour pages in particular irk me because he never *did* finish it -- but worse, they're incorrect. Despammed's filters are no more adaptive than any other set of filters; I just keep on top of spam trends.
<P>As to repeated &quot;offers&quot; from legit companies -- in many cases I can block them. But if that's the only spam you get, you're not getting spam. So to speak. But every case is different.
<P>&gt; spamcop (i take it from the cartoon) is a way of dealing with already
<BR>> received spam - does it then go back and kill the sender?
<P>It formats and documents a convenient complaint to the culprit's upstream providers, by reading the Received: headers and interpreting them cleverly. This can help, but doesn't usually. Sort of a drop-in-the-bucket effect. But get enough drops in the bucket, and there will hopefully be less spam.

<P>Well, first of all, it's possible taht the meta-cartoonist's association with Despammed had slipped Nappy's mind. Beyond that, however, is the simple fact that Despammed wouldn't have really worked in that context, because of the difference between the services provided by Despammed and SpamCop. Despammed, as far as I can tell, is only a filtering service, and really is only trly beneficial if one uses it before one becomes a spam target (or sets up a new mail account to prevent that), while SpamCop is also a spam reporting service (and that function is the only one Napoleon, as far as I know, uses.) The joke would have had to be restructured more than somewhat to use Despammed rather than SpamCop.

<P>Well, it wasn't the *only* thing we gave him. Haven't you ever received food presents for Christmas? He liked sardines, and I think they were either hard to find or too expensive where he was. Often sent him one brand which came in a sort of mustard sauce or something.

<P>well, i used to make cookies for other people, but you can decorate those with red and green sparkly things, to make them seem christmas-y. (red and green sardines would be....well, a place best not gone to). still, when you put it that way, i can see sending a special brand or something.

<P>Again, keep in mind that my grandfather lived in Arkansa s as well, so cookies would be more difficult to mail. Canned sardines and hard candies were generally the food items we were most likely to send him, as they were the best mailers. Not so different from sending one of those gift sausage packs when you think about it.

<P>that's &quot;species&quot;, not &quot;breed&quot;. the text suggests that the fish should be a salmon, but the fins, coloring, head-shape, etc., are all wrong. front end (especially the pectoral fins) resembles a tuna, but the tail is wrong (but is somewhat salmon-like). the coloring, however, faintly resembles that of a (deceased) sardine. perhaps it is the long-sought &quot;ueber-canning fish&quot;!
