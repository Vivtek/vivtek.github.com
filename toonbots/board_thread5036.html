<strong>Sweet Holy Mary Mother of God</strong>
<P>My wife defended her dissertation today and has an actual, real live doctorate in theoretical physics now.
<P>I can't believe this day has come.

<strong>Re: Sweet Holy Mary Mother of God</strong>
<P>congratulations! (mostly to her, of course, but to you too for surviving the process)
<P>just avoid the temptation to get her a batch of checks imprinted &quot;dr.&quot; - the wife of a friend of mine did that after he got his PhD - so every time he wrote a check, people would describe their various aches and pains to him. since he's an ichthyologist, he wasn't much help....

<BR>> PhD - so every time he wrote a check, people would describe their various

<P>He couldn't simply send them on to a qualified sturgeon?
<P>Congratulate the missus for us, Michael! I just slogged through my senior thesis (defense still to come, but thing is written.) 138 pages. Weeks of 5-6 hours of sleep, missed meals, digestive problems, suicidal thoughts, public displays of hysteria, banging one's head against flat surfaces. So I'm sure the dissertation was no picnic for you or her. (At least I get a semester off before trudging on to grad school.)
<P>And hey, now you can greet her every morning with &quot;What's up, Doc?&quot;

<P>and congrats to you too, emsworth! (the writing is the worst part - the defense is usually mostly a matter of not fainting in the first 5 minutes - after that, it should be smooth sailing).
<P>we need to have a party! green jello for all!
