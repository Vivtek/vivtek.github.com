<P>OOOOH, so Mr &quot;I have kids and can't go to the movies&quot; went to the movies, eh? EH? Was it an actual evening viewing with dinner before and dessert after? Huh?! HUH?!?
<P>God, I haven't been to a movie in ages. Even if we can get rid of... er find someone to watch the kids. It's like, if we go to a movie and don't like it, we've wasted our only chance in months. So we always avoid it unless we're SURE we'll love it.

<P>I never even saw the first &quot;Mummy&quot; film, though if things go well after finals, I may rent it (if only because Bernard Fox is in it.)
<P>I'd liek to see a movie or two this summer, if possible, and if i keep my scholarship. My father is particularly excited about &quot;Pearl Harbur&quot; (he's always had a penchant for war films), but I'm looking forward to &quot;Atlantis.&quot; The plot sounds unusual for Disney, and I liked the character designs I saw in the previews. I may see &quot;Shrek,&quot; but from what I have seen in previews and pictures, I'm not especially thriled about it.

<strong>Re: The Muumuu's rotten</strong>
<P>Now, Atlantis and Shrek, I *will* see, because I can take the kids. And my wife is a berzerker Jules Verne fan, so we'll all see Atlantis.
<P>And both look good.
<P>Oddly, I find myself interested by what I saw in the trailer for Jurassic Park III. They can hardly have done worse than #2, but it's my fond hope that graphics has improved even more in the intervening time. And I'm just a sucker for dinosaurs.

<strong>Re: The Muumuu's rotten</strong>
<P>I too, thought The Mummy Returns rocked! Me and my son enjoyed the first one and LOVED this one! We too, are looking forward to Shrek and Atlantis. I'd probably feel retarded going to these things by myself. Good thing I have kids! Damn, that was one fine movie!!

<P>I *could* have seen The Mummy Returns this weekend. Instead, I went to see Spy Kids. :-/ Not really sure what I was thinking...
<P>Don't get me wrong, it wasn't THAT bad. I guess I just expected more from the reviews I had read. While not a big Robert Rodriguez fan, I was curious how a kid's film from the creator of &quot;El Mariachi&quot;, &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; would turn out. After the Self-Made Critic gave it a favorable review, I decided I ought to see it before it leaves the theaters.
<P>It was...trippy. Still, it lacked something. It seemed in the end a lot like those movies that end up playing in constant rotation on the Disney Channel and HBO Family. The effects and star level were higher than in &quot;A Kid in King Arthur's Court&quot; for example, but it still had that &quot;We're dumbing this down 'cause it's for kids&quot; feel.
<P>Of course, I'm single and have no kids of appropriate age I could take as a cover story (my oldest nephew is two, so he'll be ready soon). It didn't matter though, as there were a total of six other people in the theater except for myself and my dad (I kind of sold him on going with).
<P>The previews made me surer than ever that I want to see Shrek, and at the same time warned me away from &quot;The Animal&quot; (as if the warning was necessary), and &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, of which I had been previously unaware. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; doesn't really grab me yet. I'll wait for the reviews on &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. The trailer looks decent, but then again, so did the one for &quot;The Avengers&quot;. If I can take my nephew, I'll probably see &quot;Atlantis&quot;, otherwise I'll wait for my sister to buy the DVD. I think most other summer movies fall into the category of &quot;I've heard about them but yet to see even one trailer&quot;. These include Spielberg's &quot;A.I.&quot;, Tim Burton's &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; remake, &quot;Evolution&quot;, &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot;, &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;, &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;. Okay, I've seen teaser-trailers for &quot;Evolution&quot; and &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;, but they really weren't very helpful in making a movie-watching decision.
<P>Oh, who am I kidding? If I see five movies in the theater this summer I'll handily break last year's unprecedented record-setting four and almost double my average for the past and knock my 10 year average up by almost 50%.

<strong>Summer movies</strong>
<P>&gt; I *could* have seen The Mummy Returns this weekend. Instead, I went to see
<BR>> Spy Kids. :-/ Not really sure what I was thinking...
<P>Now, kids movies I get to see. Spy Kids was OK. The rest of the family liked it, but I like a little more realism. Yeah, it sure had that Disney-channel feel to it.
<P>But, Poog? If you chose Spy Kids over The Mummy Returns, well, I think maybe it's time for that stay at the Betty Ford Clinic you've been putting off.
<P>&gt; The previews made me surer than ever that I want to see Shrek,
<P>Shrek looks like it could be good, but I'm learning to respect my new rule of thumb that Eddie Murphy is a sure sign of death for a movie. At least he's just voice talent, so maybe there's hope. Damn, he used to be good.
<P>&gt; same time warned me away from &quot;The Animal&quot;
<P>Never heard of it.
<P>&gt; &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;,
<P>That looks worth a buck fifty at the second-run cinema at the mall, anyway.
<P>&gt; &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; doesn't really grab me
<P>The trailer sure was good. I don't see how they're going to make a whole movie, though. Planes fly, planes bomb, ships sink, end of story.
<P>&gt; If I can take my nephew, I'll probably see &quot;Atlantis&quot;,
<P>I'm definitely up for Atlantis. But since we'll be out of the country from late June until early August, that's probably exactly when it'll come out. The only drawback to our annual pilgrimage to Budapest.
<P>&gt; These include Spielberg's &quot;A.I.&quot;,
<P>Boy, that looks dumb.
<P>&gt; Tim
<BR>> Burton's &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; remake,
<P>Haven't seen trailers, but I'll see the movie for sure. It can't be stupider than the original.
<P>&gt; &quot;Evolution&quot;,
<P>I don't even know what this one's about.
<P>&gt; &quot; 2&quot;,
<P>All will be complete wastes of time.
<P>Jurassic Park 3, now -- that looks like they might finally have gotten it right. We'll see.

<P>Apparently they're doing it with some sort of love-story angle at which they utterly fail to hint in the trailer (except for that half-second of whatsername screaming).
<P>As well as stuff exploding.
<P>Screw it, I'll just go watch &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; again.

<P>No, it was one of those &quot;I typeset your lab report last week including graphics, so you owe me an evening where I can slip out and see this cool movie you don't want to see anyway&quot; deals. However, with respect to said lab report, I am overjoyed to announce that my wife is now ABD -- all but dissertation -- meaning that the obscene amount of money I have given the IU Bursar over the last eon or two is now at its legal maximum.
<P>My wife and I don't go for the traditional dating thing much. She's not only a foreigner, she's weird, and I think you can all vouch for my own, um, nonconformity. Instead of a regular courtship, we did a whole lot of international travel.
<P>This is worth recounting. When we met, I was working in Stuttgart, West Germany on my first job (a warehouse automation project, really pretty neat). She was studying at Uni Stuttgart for a summer program (doing what Hungarians have done since time immemorial -- travelling to other countries who can afford technical libraries to do their research, in this case her masters' thesis in mechanical engineering.) We met when mutual friends invited us to supper. They maintained it wasn't a setup.
<P>Several days later, I had to leave town for a while. But I met her again when I got back, and took her out to eat a couple of times. As she was living on a subsistence diet, this was a successful ploy. This was 1989, and Hungary was still socialist. Exchange rates were not favorable.
<P>Several days after *that*, she left for home. But it was too late. I was smitten. I had a vacation to Belgrade coming up, so I took the train from Belgrade to Budapest and showed up by surprise. This was after sending a seventeen-page letter declaring my intentions.
<P>The combination worked rather well. She then left for Delft, Holland, and for five weeks I drove up there every weekend. During that time, I proposed, she accepted -- since we would have to have visas from the same country to get to know one another, we decided to get our visas the old-fashioned way, by getting married.
<P>Bureaucratic hilarity ensued, not lessened by the fact that the laws in Hungary were changing very rapidly during the summer of 1989. When Hungary declared they were no longer going to stop East Germans from crossing into Austria, we watched on TV as the first Trabant hit the West German border crossing. When Czechoslovakia declared that they weren't going to police the Austrian border at all, we were actually listening on the radio on the Autobahn in Austria and decided to speed up to avoid the traffic when roughly ten gazillion long-frustrated Czech shoppers left the country at midnight for the malls of Vienna. When we tried to find the necessary forms for my wife to leave Hungary after taking care of the paperwork there, we discovered they'd abolished that law and we could just ... leave.
<P>Of course, getting the paperwork required us to figure out which of the two German embassies in Budapest was still *the* German embassy in Budapest. The countries had reunified in the meantime.
<P>On every visit to Budapest that summer, there were noticeably fewer big red stars on the tops of buildings.
<P>And then, December 21, 1989, we arrived in the United States, with no money, no jobs, no car. Oddly enough, on December 21, 1990, we arrived in Indiana again, in precisely the same situation. But that's a story I'll reserve for a later telling.
<P>Ain't history grand? May you live in interesting times.
