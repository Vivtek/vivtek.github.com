<strong>Free Form Brilliance</strong>
<P>At first, I was disturbed by the lack of actual panels. It seemed to smack of a lack of concern for order and stability.
<P>(It's just occurred to me that this might also be something with my browser, but I really don't know enough about computers to say. The screen made the pretty pictures come up, so the gremlins who live in the big box called a 'tower' and make noises sometimes must be happy. Do not feed the gremlins, as an aside, even though there are ready made mouths in the front of the box. It doesn't make them happy.)
<P>*focus, Jenn....focus*
<P>Anyway, then I realized that the lack of panels is probably a metaphor for the confusion and pain we're all feeling in this topsy turvy world, where Communism just isn't what it used to be and the rules of censorship have relaxed enough that a bear can do a strip tease with his hat in a family comic.
<P>So again, kudos to the metacartoonist for yet again broadening my horizons!
<P>Jenn
<P>So...the membership card's in the mail, right? Cause if it got delivered to the wolverine pen, I think Gwendolyn might be using it as chewing gum (GRRRRRRR!). Not that I mind.

<strong>Re: Free Form Brilliance</strong>
<P>Panels was the first thing that the Toon-o-matic could do at all, so I would think that after all this time it would be something that it does right.

<BR>> to the wolverine pen, I think Gwendolyn might be using it as chewing gum
<BR>> (GRRRRRRR!). Not that I mind.
<P>A replacement should be on its way. Be sure not to let Gwendolyn near this one. Distracting her by offering various appendages for food rather than the card may help.

<P>Um, you must have looked in the about ten minutes between uploads, before I realized I'd forgotten to set the background color of the GIF to white instead of the (default) black. So the borders are effectively transparent (whereas the white spaces should be).
<P>Makes Ho look kinda neat, though, doesn't it?
<P>If you reload the picture, it should look OK. Getting IE to do that should be easy; with Netscape you have to right-click on it, show picture, and reload *that*, otherwise it figures it doesn't really need to reload the pictures, just the HTML. I think IE reloads everything when it reloads.
<P>Clear as mud? Not as cool as the gremlin theory, but it leaves you in better control.
