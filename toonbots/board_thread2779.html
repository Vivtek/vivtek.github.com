<strong><a href="mailto:toonbots@vivtek.com">Michael</a></strong> <i>Sat Mar 31 17:50:14 2001</i><br>
<strong>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: Toonbots leaving Vivtek</strong>
<P>In the course of the next few days, Toonbots will be leaving Vivtek. This is not due to any quarrel with the company, with whom my relations have always been good. I simply wish, in the style of 1970s Fleetwood Mac, to go my own way. Though obviously without the copious cocaine abuse (stay away from gak, kids). The transition to a new server will take place at some point during the next couple of weeks, at which point this message board will be closed down and unfortunately you will have to register for a new one (sorry). Also, the mailing list will revert to me delivering the strips by hand, which has been known to be erratic (sorry).
<P>I hope you will be along for this bold new age of independence. There may be a couple of days disruption but quality should remain as mediocre as you've come to expect!
<P>Michael
<P>

<P>&gt; rollicking?
<p>
<strong>Rollic</strong> \Rol"lic\ (r[o^]l"l[i^]k), v. i. [imp. & p. p. Rollicked (-l[i^]kt); p. pr. & vb. n. Rollicking.] [Corrupt. fr. frolic, under the influence of roll.] To move or
 play in a careless, swaggering manner, with a frolicsome air; to frolic; to sport; commonly in the form rollicking. [Colloq.]

<strong>Re: Oh, never MIND</strong>
<P>Sorry for not jumping on that, I check in 'bout once a week and didn't catch the spoof until 'twas far too late.
<P>I do appreciate Brother Emsworth sugguesting that my fan-art in any way inspired a offical, dare I say -canon- edition of the holy Toonbots. While I personally refrain from any such aspirations of grandneur, the thought was touching.

<P>Actually, your fan art pretty much defined Lenin's personality for me. That episode was just so darned Toonbotty (except of course that whole never-touched-by-human-hands rule).
<P>So yeah, Emsworth's 100% dead on.

<P>Sorry, doesn't count. Any non-Toon-o-Matic involvement at all disqualifies it. The only hand crafting I allow myself is the cropping of found heads. Even your manipulation of Lenin's eyebrows was non-kosher. (What's Hebrew for non-kosher? There has to be a word.)
<P>So, yeah, human hand on the mouse is already too much. Sorry, kid. Don't call us, we'll call you.

<P>&gt; You're all off my Christmas list.
<P>Sorry, I've been busy trying to stave off academic defenestration. Besides, having already embarrassed myself over on BoxJam's forum, I wasn't sure how to respond.
<P>Excellentr new Toonbots, though. I'd wondered what had become of Karl Marx. And Lenin as an advertising idea man is brilliant (though his characterization in this toon seemed influenced Tirdun's fan art, actually.)Oddly enough, though, supposedly some people do eat pickles for breakfast (or at least, in one of Wodehouse's Mulliner stories [&quot;Came the Dawn,&quot; to be exact], the protagonists uncle had made his fortune manufacturing Briggs' Breakfast Pickles.)
<P>Speaking of Wodehouse, I'm touched by your mentioning me on the main page (though I don't recall quoting Wodehouse that much on this particular forum, though I probably did at some point, in my efforts to spread sweetness and light, and whatnot.)

<strong>Re: Oh, never MIND</strong>

<P>You have an excuse. The rest of this rabble has none.
<P>&gt; Besides, having already embarrassed myself over on BoxJam's forum, I
<BR>> wasn't sure how to respond.
<P>Embarrassed? You were the one who twigged first! I had emailed him saying if he needed automation work done, I'd be happy to do it. Marketing becomes a kneejerk reaction for a sole proprietor.
<P>&gt; Excellentr new Toonbots, though.
<P>Why thank you!
<P>&gt; I'd wondered what had become of Karl
<BR>> Marx.
<P>So had I. He's not getting enough air time. Neither is Shakespeare. But Shakespeare is too angry; it's hard to work him in, really.
<P>&gt; And Lenin as an advertising idea man is brilliant (though his
<BR>> characterization in this toon seemed influenced Tirdun's fan art,
<BR>> actually.)
<P>See my response to Tirdun, but you're right.
<P>&gt; Oddly enough, though, supposedly some people do eat pickles for
<BR>> breakfast (or at least, in one of Wodehouse's Mulliner stories [&quot;Came
<BR>> the Dawn,&quot; to be exact], the protagonists uncle had made his fortune
<BR>> manufacturing Briggs' Breakfast Pickles.)
<P>My daughter eats pickles at any opportunity. I actually came up with the joke with her. My problem, of course, with commercials is that my kids are too young and don't watch TV, and my wife is European and never saw any of the commercials I refer to. Same goes for Gilligan's Island quotes, etc. So as regards nd's aspersions about my lack of pop-culture street cred, I'd just like to say that in my household I am a pop-culture street cred god.
<P>Well. My daughter is getting to the age where she absorbs it via osmosis.
<P>&gt; Speaking of Wodehouse, I'm touched by your mentioning me on the main page
<BR>> (though I don't recall quoting Wodehouse that much on this particular
<BR>> forum, though I probably did at some point, in my efforts to spread
<BR>> sweetness and light, and whatnot.)
<P>You didn't. It's just funny. And I'm building up your Jihad alter ego here. It's all part of a plan which I may follow through on, or may not, depending on how much time I have. You know. The Toonbots creed: funny at all costs except if I'm busy!
