<P>THAT THE GREAT AND WISE MOUSE HAS INSINUATED INCOMPLETENESS IN FULL UNDERSTANDING ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS THIS POWERFUL TOONBOTS TOOL IS EXCELLENT NEWS FOR US OF THE UNITED ARMED PENGUIN FRONT OF WHICH YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE BUT WHICH YOU WILL ACCEPT THE LATTER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE DECLARE OTHERWISE. ALTHOUGH PERHAPS MOUSE IS SIMPLY ADMITTING THIS TO THROW US OFF AS A SUBTLE HINT AT A POSSIBLE LIMIT TO THE OTHERWISE BOUNDLESS MENTAL POWERS OF THE MOUSE. WE MUST ADMIT THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO TREMBLE AT THE THOUGHT OF CHALLENGING THIS MOUSE TO PEBBLE HOLDING COMPETITIONS OR SLIDING FOR DOMINANT STANDING PLACES WITHIN THE HOME ROOKERIE AND WHILE SOME SEE THIS AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS OTHERS ARE NOW CLAIMING THAT IT IS A TRICK AND IT HAS FURTHERED THE NEARLY MYTHICAL IMAGE OF MOUSE WHO IS EVEN NOW QUIETLY ADORED WITH SMALL MOUSE SNOW STATUES AND OFFERINGS OF FISH. THIS RUNS AGAINST THE CENTRAL DRIVE OF THE UNITED ARMED PENGUIN FRONT TOWARD WORLD CONQUEST AND SEAFOOD PLENTY AND IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT MOUSE'S NAME STANDS ALMOST FIRST OR AT LEAST SOMEWHERE AT THE TOP SECTION OF THE FIRST FEW PAGES IN THE BOOK OF THOSE WHO HAVE CHALLENGED OUR QUEST SO NOTED WITH AN UNDERLINE, PARENTHESIS AND EVEN AN AMPERSTAND TO SET IT APART FROM OTHER POWERFUL ENEMIES SUCH AS JERRY LEWIS AND DAN QUAYLE. WE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED AND NONEXISTANT UNITED ARMED PENGUIN FRONT TREMBLE TO REMEMBER THE EPIC BATTLES AGAINST JERRY LEWIS AND HIS DEFENDERS OF FREEDOM AT HISTLETHORPE AND UPON THE BLOODY FIELDS OF FARGO. THOSE WERE INDEED DARK DAYS. WE SHALL TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER THE FALLEN AND TO REMIND YOU THAT THERE IS NO UNITED ARMED PENGUIN FRONT.

<P>well, it's about time someone showed up here again.
<P>for your information, i was referring to the mere, or fen, penguin, inhabitant of meres, mires, fens, bogs and sloughs. it is a small, rather muddy brown creature, of morose mein, subsisting on minnows, frogs and the occasional landlocked cuttlefish, and can be identified by its cries of 'ack! ack!'. they are unafraid of humans, and when one appears among them, they tend to encircle him (or her) and stand staring up at her (or him), occasionally uttering small dismal sighs. after a while, they shake their heads and wander off. this has proven unnerving (to say the least) to investigators, some of whom are sufficiently shaken by the experience that they discontinue scientific pursuits and either spend the rest of their lives huddled in dark closets, sobbing fitfully, or crouched in smoky independantly-owned coffee houses, attempting to survive as beat poets.
<P>at the very least i hope you are using a pink highlighter, as the yellow just looks faded. or blue - blue is cool.
