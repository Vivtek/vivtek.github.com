<p>
<i>(Margust 23, 2003)</i> (<a href="toon20030230.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I've been really depressed lately.  I'd like to take this opportunity
to apologize to anyone outside the United States of America for the
unbelievable turn of events of late.  I voted in the majority back in
2000, as you all surely know by now, but obviously that wasn't enough.
The juggernaut is out of control at this point, and hopefully not
too many people will die before America decides to go back to being
what it's supposed to be.
<p>
Anyway, my news addiction has been really out of control for the
past.. well, frankly, since 2001.  I used to figure that if anything
important happened, I'd hear about it.  Now I think  I don't want to
hear about it anyway.  I'm done.  No more news for me ever.
<p>
<i>(Janune 5, 2003)</i> (<a href="toon20030105.html">the toon</a>)<br>
OK, maybe not <i>every</i> day.  I wouldn't want you all to get too
spoiled.
<p>
<i>(Janunary 1, 2003)</i> (<a href="toon20030101.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Pfft, *pfff* -- Is this thing on?  Hey!  It still works!
<p>
So -- I'm back.  Didja miss me?  I spent some time in political blog land
and did a kind of Rip-van-Winkle elfland thing.  Suddenly, two months had
passed!  Anyway, the archives are kinda sorta working (although the XML
source is being mangled, long story but I can fix it!  Really!)  Publishing
of a toon isn't as easy as it was with the old code -- yet.  Soon it'll
be easier.  And after that I'm going to make the Toon-o-Matic open to the
public at last.  'Bout durned time I put my money where my mouth is.
<p>
<i>(November 27, 2002)</i> (no toon still)<br>
Not Dead Yet.  Really.  It's been a year now that Toonbots has been nearly
moribund, especially over the last couple of months.  Soon, my children,
things will change.
<p>
<i>(October 6, 2002)</i> (no toon)<br>
Wow.  Y'know, even at the prospect of imminent senseless and illegal war on
Iraq, I'm still finding life worth living, for several reasons: my son doesn't
have an ear infection this week, the weather is absolutely stunning, there is
apparently the beginnings of an Anti-DMCA legislative proposal before Congress,
and today I read <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n19/liev01_.html">an article</a>
which has managed to explain to me what the heck the Republicans think they're
doing, making my life as a liberal in rural Indiana start to make sense.  (I
mean, yeah, they're <i>wrong</i>, but they're no longer fully inexplicable to
me, and that makes me feel so much more stable in life.)
<p>
Also, I've discovered the music of the A-Teens.  OK, I admit it -- I always
liked ABBA.  Now I have ABBA to a techno beat, except that their original tracks
are far superior to their ABBA covers.  I've currently got "Halfway Around the
World" on loop.  At least it's a nice break from Falco (my other Gnutella
fixation this week.)  The A-Teens also had a track (an Elvis cover, natch) on
the <i>Lilo and Stitch</i> soundtrack.
<p>
So -- beautiful weather -- good music -- healthy kids -- possible legislation
against rapacious corporate piracy -- less philosophical opacity -- yeah, life
is good.  Oh, and we found a Hungarian-speaking babysitter in town today.
Life <i>is</i> good.  Maybe my wife and I will be able to see a movie together
for the first time this year soon.  Wow.
<p>
<i>(October 4, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20021004.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Yo!  I'm sort of back.  This is definitely an episode, but of course I make no promises as to continued presence or consistency.
I do like my blurb today.
<p>
<i>(September 11, 2002)</i><br>
I'd like to dedicate today to the memory of the more than 4000 innocent lives lost in Afghanistan as a result of <i>my</i>
government's acts of revenge and hatred.  This crime cannot be justified by the innocent lives lost in New York and Washington
and Pennsylvania a year ago today; even if the Afghan state, such as it was, had perpetrated those crimes, killing more women and
children in revenge is wrong.  Add to that the fact that this path of evil has been spectacularly unsuccessful, with Osama bin Laden
still at large, with most of the Taliban still at large, with most of Al-Qa'ida still at large, and that it has cost our already
staggering nation untold <i>billions</i> of conveniently unaccounted dollars -- and you have the desperate posings of a man trying
to feel Presidential and popular.
<p>
<i>(September 8, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020908.html">the toon</a>)<br>
It appears that in fixing the <a href="board_archives.html">message board archiving system</a> that I broke the cartoon episode
archiving system.  I was afraid that might happen.  In the next day or two I'll restore the episode archive.  Sorry about that.
Unfortunately, it means that if you're coming in fresh, there's no possible chance you'll have any clue what any of this is about.
<p>
<i>(August 24, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020824.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I'm losing it.  It took me nearly half a minute to work out the correct
spelling of <strike>excersize</strike> <strike>exersise</strike> <strike>excersise</strike> practice.
<p>
<i>(August 21, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020804.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Did I mention I'm terribly busy?  Classic Chris, always Cool Enough, has submitted a fan XML episode.  It's on the queue, Chris.  Right
after Tirdun's, now 8 months old and aging rather gracefully.  Here at Toonbots, we post no episode before its time.  We're very
conservative in that respect.
<p>
<i>(July 26, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020726.html">the toon</a>)<br>
We went to the Monroe County Fair yesterday.  Ate hot dogs and giant tenderloins and funnel cakes and felt a little sick afterwards, slid down the giant slide and went on the Ferris wheel, and speculated on the SEE HEADLESS WOMAN STILL ALIVE, inspected the chickens and the bunnies and the cows and the hogs, tried to understand what the auctioneer was saying, watched the four-wheeler racing, got lots of balloons and a fresh supply of notepads from the local politicians, listened to some pretty good live country and gospel music by local musicians (Bloomington has a *lot* of extremely good local musicians), paid too much for some silly pick-up-the-boat-and-win-a-prize thing, the prizes consisting of two plastic ninja swords and a really big inflatable hammer, and just generally had a really fun time.
<p>
Now that's the real America.  And you know what?  Terrorism can't touch it.
<p>
I find it somewhat flabbergasting to realize that it had been a month since
I last posted an episode.  Time flies when you're buried under a workload which
would crush two or three demigods.  At least most of the workload at the
moment will actually be paid, though.  That's kind of a nice switch after the
last few months.
<p>
<i>(June 23, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020623.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Ha!  When you least expect it -- <i>expect it!</i>  I do wish I knew what
this blurb meant, though.
<p>
<i>(June 19, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020619.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I've been saving this joke up for a while now, chuckling about it every now and then.  Hee, hee.  I crack myself up.
<p>
<i>(June 16, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020616.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Now that's a blurb.
<p>
<i>(June 14, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020614.html">the toon</a>)<br>
In case you're wondering, the Bot is usually channelling my WinAmp playlist.
<p>
<i>(June 12, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020612.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Yeah, so <a href="http://www.techspex.com/">I've</a> <a href="http://www.despammed.com/">been</a> <a href="http://www.myguard.net/">BUSY</a>, <a href="http://health.sdsc.edu:8080/IPBIR/">you</a> <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/wftk/">know</a><a href="http://www.cogsci.indiana.edu">?</a>
So sue me.
<p>
<i>(May 22, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020522.html">the toon</a>)<br>
One of Lord Emsworth's two hiatal submissions today.  His blurb was particularly hilarious, I think.
<p>
<i>(Aprober 21, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020421.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Dang, I love this song.  It just says so much that you can really only understand starting in your thirties, when you've got a
couple of decades of media exposure under your belt.  And it does make a nice exercise in retrospective, with those tight rhymes and
rhythm patterns.  In reading back through my archive, which I hadn't done in a while -- I realize I really <i>do</i> like Toonbots.
Dare I say it -- it's my kind of humor!  Which is a relief, given that I write it.
<p>
Anyway, three episodes in a week means I'm back to normal, I guess.  I still have Emsworth's and Tirdun's hiatus submissions.
<p>
<i>(Aprober 16, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020416.html">the toon</a>)<br>
No comment.
<p>
<i>(Aprober 14, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020414.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I been busy.  And then I was sick.  I really want to get back into the content generation groove, though.
<p>
Sigh.
<p>
<i>(Margust 17, Saint Patrick's Day, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020317,html">the toon</a>)<br>
Well, that's two episodes in one month, so things are getting back to normal!  In case you're wondering
about what the blurb is talking about, it's the cloning ban that the House has already <i>passed</i>
with very little public fanfare.  Among other things, this ban will prohibit the import of anything
made using cloning, meaning that if you take your child to Europe for a diabetes cure based on
therapeutic (i.e. non-reproductive) cloning, it will be illegal to bring the child back into the
United States.  Healthy,
but exiled.  Smart money is on the idea that Congress doesn't know what the hell it's talking
about; I'm not sure exactly who would benefit from a cloning ban in the first place, but anybody
with more than two neurons to rub together should agree that an absolute ban is ... stupid.
<p>
I'm pretty sure America is a lost cause at this point.  Russia is now the leading capitalist
nation in spaceflight (they'll be starting space tourism in a couple of years, if all goes well,
while NASA gets cuts but simultaneously hinders what passes for American capitalism in its
quest to commercialize space.)  Europe has realized it's stupid to criminalize drug abuse, electing
instead to treat it.  Nobody else in the world thinks that cloning for medical purposes is a bad
idea, and fifty years ago neither would we.
<p>
By 2020 it's all going to be over -- America will be the Empire, ruled by a small oligarchy of CEOs
and trade organizations, backing up its interests with open military power, nuclear where necessary.
Decent medicine will be available only to the rich, as they smuggle their families to Europe
for treatment and bribe their way past Customs to return.  There will be an American Space Force,
but aside from expensive commercial flights run by Boeing and MacDonnell-Douglas as showcases to prove that
we haven't lost our edge, all commercial
space flight will be Russian and Chinese.  The only places to go will be European, Russian,
Chinese and Japanese anyway, so that won't matter much.
<p>
Dystopic science fiction is fun, but let's face it -- in reality, it sucks.  Don't any of these
people ever read cautionary tales?  I guess not.  America, we'll miss you.
<p>
<i>(Margust 7, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020307.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Boy, did I need a hiatus!  We'll see if it's over or not in another couple of days, I suppose.
Februember was a horrible month all around, as the server developed some irritating (and for my
largest client, show-stopping) quirks.  I'm pretty sure, in the final analysis, that it was the
fact that our ISP changed name servers.  Yeah, sounds pretty lame, but that's system administration for ya.
<p>
At any rate, things are feeling a little more like even-keeled now, and maybe it's time for me to
start hacking out Toonbots again.  I have multiple-episode submissions from Emsworth and Tirdun,
and so those will be coming up Real Soon Now.  I've got some ideas (but not time, yet) for some
Toon-o-Matic extensions that might not be terribly difficult to implement.
<p>
Did you miss me?
<p>
<i>(Janune 18, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020118.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Where the heck did <i>this</i> come from?  Sometimes I can't even tell the voices in my head apart.
<p>
I'm pretty sure it's Toonbots, though.  At least, it leaves me just as confused as most of them do.
<p>
<i>(Janune 7, 2002)</i> (<a href="toon20020107.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Yes, the hiatus is working out, as mouse has herewith supplied me not with one, not with two, but with <i>three</i> excellent
Toonbotty episodes, just plain dripping with that uniquely Toonbots flavor of humor.  Now I realize that maybe if I weren't already
doing Toonbots, I <i>would</i> be reading Toonbots.  Thanks, mouse!
<p>
<i>(Deciduous 29, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011229.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Whelp, it's difficult to tell it, since I just posted an episode, but I've been
on hiatus for a whole day now.  Yep.  And cold turkey on all Web toons, as a
matter of fact (except for Sluggy Freelance because it was the middle of the
Christmas story arc and this is the third year I've been a Sluggite, and
Christmas without a good showdown between Bun-Bun and the Claus family just
wouldn't be Christmas.  It'd be like forgetting the eggnog.)
<p>
Anyhoo, frankly, I'm feeling much less stressed now that I'm toonfree.  I'm
toying with some fun programming, and getting some work done at long last,
and all in all, it's a Good Thing.  Which, given the <i>vast</i>, indeed the
<i>cosmically vast</i> amounts of time I spent on Toonbots, is ... indicative
of some seriously disturbed psychology, methinks.
<p>
As posted on the <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/toonbots/discuss.pl?read=3283">forum</a>,
the way is now open for you, Gentle Reader, to be metacartoonist for a day, or
a week, or heck, just fifteen minutes if that's all you want to spare.  Give me
episodes and see your name in lights.  Or at least in the blurb.  But they've
gotta be in XML.  It's not like you don't have more than a hundred examples!
<p>
<i>(Deciduous 17, 2001)</i><br>
After last week's six-day binge, I find myself intimidated.  So instead of doing an episode, I read <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/biz6/zebra/first.html">Zebra Girl</a>'s entire archive.  I recommend you do the same.  It's <i>that good</i>.  *snif* I wish I could draw.
<p>

<i>(Deciduous 12, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011212.html">the toon</a>)<br>
What?  Three days in a row again?  And I have good ideas for another two.  Looks like a full week of daily output here.  How 'bout
<i>them</i> apples?

<p>
Amazingly, my <a href="/wftk/">workflow project</a> made actual press -- the Dec. 5 issue of <i>Intelligent Enterprise</i> lists the
wftk as an open-source XML-based task and workflow manager.  Cool beans!

<p>
<i>(Deciduous 10, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011210.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Just when I think I'll never again have time or energy to deal with Toonbottery, an episode bursts forth and I can't help but
write it down.
<p>
<i>(Novuary 29, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011129.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Buried!  Inundated!  Awash with work!  It never stops.
<p>
<i>(Novuary 23, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011123.html">the toon</a>)<br>
This episode cracks me up.  I feel good about Toonbots and life today.  Today (well, yesterday, but I haven't been to bed yet) we
cooked a regular feast: turkey, sweet potatoes (butter, fresh-squeezed orange juice, some soy sauce, a dash of cinnamon, and all the
marshmallows in the house), corn on the cob, green bean casserole (cream of mushroom soup, milk, and lots of French-fried onions),
stuffing (fried chicken liver, kolbasz, sour cream, butter, and Pepperidge Farms cornbread stuffing mix), oh, and turkey soup (the
wings of the turkey, parsnips, potatoes, kohlrabi, and the turkey's giblets).  Just for the four of us.  We had the same for supper,
except that my wife took some of the potatoes and the leftover fat and chicken livers and fried them together.  Aaaah.  Nothing like
Hungarian cuisine.

<p>
But what really has my mood up is seeing Dan Goldin on PBS yesterday (well, day before yesterday, but you know what I mean) -- if you
don't know, he's leaving NASA.  And he sure is pumped about technology issues over the next ten years.  And says within twenty we'll
have a manned (personned?) Mars mission.
<p>
So I'm happy.
<p>

<i>(Novuary 15, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011115.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I can see a whole week of cheap shots like this one -- it keeps me quasi-daily and <i>still</i> leaves me time to work!  Oh, sure, you
hate me for it <i>now</i> -- but this will read really well in the archives and you know it.
<p>
<i>(Novuary 13, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011113.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Now, I like this episode.  This is Toonbots.
<p>
By the way, <a href="http://eattheroses.keenspace.com/">Meaghan Quinn</a> <i>is</i> Cool Enough, because she linked to Toonbots
from her newsbox.  This proceeded roughly to triple my traffic.  Sigh.  Anyway, go read Eat The Roses, assuming you're one of the vanishingly
small percentage of people who didn't link here from there anyway, because the art is lovely and
the story is good, too.  And there's some fourth-wall humor in there, too.  Good stuff.  Thanks, Meaghan!
<p>
<i>(Novuary 12, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011112.html">the toon</a>)<br>
OK, I'm feeling more confident this week.  Yeah.  I think maybe I'm past this little productivity slowdown we've been suffering through.
Work is ... still in stacks higher than my head, but they're not as <i>far</i> above my head now.
<p>
<i>(October 31, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011031.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Or not.
<p>
<i>(October 25, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011025.html">the toon</a>)<br>
OK.  Two days in a row.  Maybe things might get back to abnormal.
<p>
<i>(October 24, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011024.html">the toon</a>)<br>
The problem with curmudgeonry is that it tends to induce a negative worldview.  So today I decided that's stupid.  Now I'm just going
to be a happy-go-lucky entertainer, that's me.  Yep.  I always liked Arlo Guthrie's _Alice's Restaurant Massacree_, and if you don't
know it, you're missing out on a lot.  I may or may not turn it into a whole storyline -- you know my track record there -- but I think
this one little episode isn't too shabby.
<p>

<i>(October 19, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011019.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I'm sick of seeing GOD BLESS AMERICA on every plastic-letter sign in the entire country.  The surfeit of flags -- and the stupid,
God-awful, tasteless commercials hawking everything from easy-to-install window flags to painted New York quarters -- this is
all making me more irritated with my fellow human beings than normal.  Curmudgeonry has always come easy to me, and now that it's
further out of fashion than usual, I find it impossible to resist.  Yah, rah, go go go, America has lots to show! A-M-E-R-I-C-A,
what's that spell?  Shal-low, shal-low, YEAH!

<p>
OK, I admit it, I feel better now.  Now stop bothering me, I have work to get done.
<p>
<i>(October 17, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011017.html">the toon</a>)<br>
My to-do list is actually getting shorter!  I'm (marginally) ahead of the game!  So I'll try to return to a quasi-daily schedule.
We'll see how successful I am.
<p>
Oh, and I'd like to note that <a href="http://framed.keenspace.com">Damonk</a> has Toonbots at #7 on his top-ten list for
September/October...  That's higher than <a href="http://www.choppingblock.org">Chopping Block</a>, thus confirming my prior
belief that Frank has at least one screw missing in that Acadian head of his.  But it is nice of him.  Gawrsh.
<p>
<i>(October 9, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011009.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Doesn't look good for my vaunted dailiness.  I'm buried.  Swamped.  Overwhelmed.  Busy.
<p>
<i>(October 4, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011004.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I've done a hundred of these things.  Unbelievable.  The first one really was just a joke.  Then I started taking it seriously...
<p>
<i>(October 1, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20011001.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Wow.  It's October already.
<p>
Not much of a blurb today, sorry.  Sometimes it just doesn't click.
<p>
<i>(September 30, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010930.html">the toon</a>)<br>
You know, once you break a constraint, it's hard to get the worms back into the can -- my original rule was never to modify
the floating heads by hand, except to clean them up from whatever clipart source I found them in.  But I made Osama's eyes all
hyp-mo-tized like that, and now I'm stuck.  Three aspects to Osama so far, and they're storyline-dependent.  I told myself I'd
never do that.  Dang.
<p>
But it's just so <i>funny</I>!
<p>
What I need to do, in order to preserve my artistic integrity, is to make things like "hypno eyes" an aspect by themselves --
but for that to work, the character definitions for clip-art characters like Mao and Lenin would have to encode points which would
be used by such a macro, and possibly other metrics as well.  So, for instance, a "dark glasses" aspect would have to have information
about the location of the eyes, but also about the approximate width and orientation of the face (or whatever is passing for a face).
<p>
This is something I'd planned right from the get-go with aspects, but it'll take a boatload of work to do.  And I just don't have time.
But when I <i>do</i> get time -- and I will eventually -- stand back!  The Toon-o-Matic will start to be worthy of the name!  Because
then I'll be able to encode an entire face in terms of aspects on a blank oval.  And that's pretty darned cool.
<p>

Oh, that wacky Osama bin Laden.  His beard will never be the same again.  I never knew Lenin could be so ... focussed.

<i>(September 27, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010927.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Whew!  I'm glad it's safe to joke about this mess now!  (The Onion's entire weekly issue devoted to the aftermath of 
"the events" allowed me to heave a great sigh of relief, as I realized the public is starting to get ready to laugh.  America
is still normal!)
<p>
Anyway, I've spent entirely too much time over the last two weeks with empassioned pleas to preserve basic American liberties
and avoid wasting money on a stupid war.  So far, we haven't done the latter, so things are halfway, and it also appears that
Herr Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer Ashcroft hasn't yet managed to fool Congress into forgetting the Constitution, either -- so maybe there's
hope for the nation yet.
<p>

The tricky part about terrorist attacks is how to do relevant humor without really ticking people off...
<p>
<i>(September 24, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010924.html">the toon</a>)<br>
It occurred to me that Damonk thoughtlessly left this portal lying around the Toon-o-Matic operation center...  Who am I to deny
the Toonbots cast of characters their inalienable right to run rampage through Webtoondom?
<p>
<i>(September 22, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010922.html">the toon</a>)<br>
My goodness, thank God <i>that's</i> over.  Yes, nearly two months and more than 80 cartoonists' worth of the Great Framed!!!
Escape are now behind us, and the climactic contribution of the Toon-o-Matic is now finished.  Wasn't it cool?  I did a lot of
thinking about how deeply non-normal Toonbots really is, and realized as well that the iconic nature of the regular Toonbots
run is due in large part to the relative rigidity of the capabilities of the Toon-o-Matic.  When Damonk posed perfectly normal
scripting requirements, I found it was really, really difficult to do something approximating them.
<p>
Anyway, Mao and Lenin and Shakespeare are still at large.  They'll show up sooner or later.  And the wolverines are still
wreaking havoc at Keen (Gav's been up late, he said so.)  So the whole thing hasn't played out entirely, but at least I can
spend a little less time on each episode for a while.  Whew.
<p>
<i>(September 19, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010919.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I like the way this one turned out.  Finally the whole panel layout machinery managed to support something integral to something
approaching a storyline.  The work wasn't wasted.
<p>
<i>(September 18, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010918.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I thought it would be <i>easier</i> if someone else were telling me a basic storyline.  Instead, this is more like <i>work</i> or
something.  I had no idea how much of Toonbots was driven by the peculiar constraints the Toon-o-Matic places on its form....
<p>

Well, the drawing, as always, will be easy.  It'll be <i>hard to design</i>.

Ugh.  Two missing days again -- but my translation job is done!  Yay!  Now I can start on this new workflow job I just got!  Yay!
<p>
So I've been thinking, as have we all, and really,
while I obviously don't condone blowing up the WTC, I'm not
anything like as shocked as I see people being all around me.  You'd think America
hadn't ever killed civilians.  You'd think America had never attacked anyone with
no warning (Sudan, anyone?) 
A lot of the
world lives like this all the time, except <i>worse</i>, because they have no hope of
recovery, and had no beautiful skyscrapers to begin with.  To cry about it being us
-- that's damned hypocritical.  Why is it worse that it's New York innocents
instead of Bosnian, Israeli, Afghan, Iraqi, Chechen, Mexican, Vietnamese,
Cambodian, East Timorese, Latin American?  The answer, if anything makes *any*
sense, is: there can be no difference.  If the least of us is in pain, we all
suffer, and America has now been reminded of that.  <i>I</i> have been
reminded of that.  My God, I used to take part in anti-nuke demonstrations in
Germany, and now, what?  Once every year or two I write my Senator about the DMCA
or something?  That's lame.
<p>
And imagine -- this damage just <i>wasn't that bad</i>.  What if it had been a suitcase
nuke?  Instead of Manhattan being closed south of 14th street until Monday, it
could have been closed for the next 25,000 years halflife.  With a death toll of
millions instead of thousands.  What if it had been a biological agent?  Everybody
in the hemisphere could be missing family members right now.  What if it had been
-- gasp -- an EMP, and we wouldn't have computers anymore?  (I would at this point
be swimming to Afghanistan to throttle bin Laden myself in that case.  Nothing
better to do.  And there is, after all, $5,000,000 on his head courtesy of the
FBI...  Hmm....  (My wife has already suggested that we do that.  Sigh.  An
incurable romantic, that woman.))
<p>
We will survive this -- and maybe, just maybe, the
result will be not only this outpouring of love and support across America, but a
net increase in justice throughout the world.  Maybe America won't react to this by
getting ever closer to a fascist central government for fear of terrorism (clear
win for terrorism) but will instead decide that it Has To Stop Here, and actually
<i>become</i> that beacon of freedom and opportunity to which our *ahem* President
alluded Tuesday night.
<p>
Hey.  It could happen.  We used to be all that.  If we're serious about being
Americans, we can do it again.
<p>
In the meantime, donate money to the Red Cross for the relief effort, and in two
weeks, assuming you haven't given blood, go in and donate for the thousands of
people across America who need heart surgery even when a lot of people need the
blood first.
<p>
<i>(September 11, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010911.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Some Webtoonists thought that posting today might be in poor taste, but I think it's important that life go on.  It will anyway, after
all.  And giving those morons the posthumous benefit of making my day contain less humor -- well, forget about it.  I'm finding what
enjoyment I can (after all, even if people died, you have to admit it was damned impressive to see the <i>World Trade Center fall down</i>).
Tomorrow I'm giving blood, and I will continue to do so as often as possible, because it's time to get off my derriere and make sure
that other people's lives can go on, too.
<p>
<i>(September 10, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010910.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Shyeeah, like <i>this</i> joke hasn't been used by a hundred cartoonists already.  Oh well, funny once, funny thrice, that's what
my grandfather used to say.
<p>
<i>(September 7, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010907.html">the toon</a>)<br>
So at 3 AM this morning, after adding a bunch of big, boring flowcharts to my translation job, I did a little channel surfing, which
in our house is really, really quick, because we only get one channel: PBS.  This saves us all a lot of time.  Anyway, on PBS was a
little concert given at the White House by the Marine Corps band, OK?  And it was insipid -- oh, it was executed with great technical
precision and beauty, yes.  But the selection was insipid, and my wife and I (yeah, she's often awake in the middle of the night) figured
that what happens is that the President's advisors kind of, well, <i>advise</i> everybody to make sure that such things aren't too
challenging or anything.  The overall impression is that they're trying to convince Georgie that he's really President, and that being
President of America is a really cool thing.  But if you look at his face, you just see him kind of thinking, "Gotta not screw this up."
And his wife!  She's sitting there with this look on her face, like, "God, George, you haven't screwed up yet!"
<p>
I've written Perl scripts that would make better Presidents.  I weep for this nation and I weep for the historical path that has
brought us to the point where rich people can steal the Presidency and <i>not get caught</i>.  It's all plausibly deniable, and so
we go about our lives and hope it won't get worse.  I'm pretty sure it will.  The "America" meme -- the original one, the one the
founding fathers built with care and supported with things like public libraries and an educational system that ensured that every
citizen could function as a citizen -- that meme is dead.  Long dead.  In its place is the "Corporate America" meme -- the one that
talks about the American Dream as if it were just broadband access and HDTV, and not the ability of any American to forge his or her
own way in the world without being disturbed by busybodies and barons.  Corporate America is a religion, a religion of power and wealth
that is a much more effective opiate for the masses than Catholicism ever had any hope of being.  Corporate America is busy conquering the
world, making sure that the poor stay poor and the rich get Ferraris and cell phones, and it's doing its best to make the America I
grew up loving stay as dead as possible.
<p>
In my personal life, I try to keep America alive.  I own my own business.  I home school my kids (so they actually learn something).
I promote open-source software so that you can run <i>your</i> (small) business without Microsoft 0wn1ng j00.  I even chip into the Web
comic scene, right?  But it's all pissing in the wind, because America is dead already; there are just a few burning embers here and
there in the ashes.  If we had some dry sticks we could bring it all back to life and roast some marshmallows, but the brush pile is
empty, people.  And it rained last night.
<p>
I think my rhetoric is getting away from me again, but I'm not in a happy mood today.  They're ruining things and I can't stop them.
<p>
<i>(September 4, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010904.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Hmm.  Today's was provoked by a comment over at wunderland.com -- but I can't find the comment; Brother Emsworth dredged it out of
Google's cache, so I'm not going to link to it here.  The comment was this (and it's not on the page any more, I just checked):
<blockquote>
Hard on the eyes, lame, but a hilarious concept to the geeks among us. The comic is not written, it is defined using XML, a universal data definition language, and then generated using the
        Toon-o-Matic program. He gives the source code for each comic! Haw (snort!). The author writes: To me, the Toon-o-Matic itself is the work of art. The strip is a by-product. Like hot dogs.
</blockquote>
Now, I think this is a pretty favorable reviewlet, but Lenin, as we know, is a pretty sensitive guy...  Anyway, that's the background.

I'm not going to let it get me down, though; I'm going to keep plugging.  After all, you've got an episode today and it was even a
holiday.  So count yerself lucky, kid.
<p>
We'll see about tomorrow.  Tomorrow I'm taking the kids to the Zoo.  The neat thing about home schooling is you can have a field

Storyline anxiety.  Also, did I mention that we're home schooling our daughter?  And that my wife is all-but-dissertation and has
demanded at least two full days on campus per week?  And that I accepted a 48,000 word translation project, two more technical
articles, a new open-source tool which will be used at ProZ.com, a bid for part of a wxPython project involving a really groovy
database of all the German union contracts by local area, my regular sysadmin tasks for several clients, cognitive science research
with CRCC, <i>and</i> we're launching a new
nationwide dialup service with automatic spam filtration?  And you people want daily comics?  HA!  Well, they <i>aren't going to make

<p>
*coff*  I feel much better now, thank you.
<p>
<i>(August 27, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010827.html">the toon</a>)<br>
I'm tired.  I'm only 2700 words into my 48,000 word document and my head is full of optical fiber.  Anyway, given that I don't really
have any better ideas, I figured I'd read the <u>Three Musketeers</u> and from there, well, the current storyline just kind
of became obvious, didn't it?  The only thing is, I don't know who Mao is yet, because I've only read chapter one.  So things
might get a little ... confused.  But if they didn't, it wouldn't be Toonbots!
<p>
I'm thinking the Toonbot would make a pretty interesting Cardinal Richelieu...
<p>
Interestingly, the hit counter tipped up over 50 today to the home page.  (Well, if there had <i>been</i> a hit counter per se, it
<i>would</i> have tipped up over 50.)  Of course, 10% of that was Eric Schissel.  Thanks, Eric.  And thanks to the rest of you as
well.  If only I were selling banner space here...

<p>
So this concludes the second consecutive week of daily Bots.  (Except for weekends, but if I hear any complaints
about <i>that</i> it's the wolverines for you, followed by a visit from the kindly High Chancellor of Defenestration.)
I'm going to try for another week, but as you know, there are no promises around here, because the paying customers
come first.  But it's looking good, because I've got the episode-writing game down to a fine art; I can knock one out
in about half an hour.  I'm working on ways to cut that time down.  And yes, I know I keep promising public access to
the Toon-o-Matic.  I haven't forgotten it.  Eventually it will happen.
<p>
<i>(August 21, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010821.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Now I'm officially scared.  If my code were set up to handle it, I'd now have a buffer of at least a day.  This just ain't
natural.  By the way, the hit page is officially back up over 40 per day to the home page.  Through extensive experimentation,
I've ascertained that around 30 people, machines, and other entities will hit the page even if I post only once in 16 days, and
that increasing the frequency of posting appears to increase the amount of traffic to the site....
<p>
It was all just in the interests of science, people.  I really didn't <i>enjoy</i> making Napoleon cry.
<p>
<i>(August 20, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010820.html">the toon</a>)<br>
OK, this is starting to scare me.  The wolverines are eating my brain!  The wolverines, I tell you!  Trout!  (And besides:

<p>
<i>(August 17, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010817.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Only twice in Toonbots history has an episode been posted on every weekday of a single week (well, now three times.)
And I can keep this up all night, folks.  I'm not proud.  Or <i>tired</i>, so just wait for the four chords to come
around, and sing along, like this: "You can get anything you want / At Alice's Restaurant."
<p>
I think I need some sleep.  Before I do a really long music video episode...  Hmm....  The twenty-four eight-by-ten
color glossy photographs with the circles and arrows on'em explaining what each one was to be used in court against
us....
<p>
<i>(August 16, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010816.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Pfft.  Next thing you know I'll have a buffer or something and this'll be just another boring
daily.  Unbelievable, folks.  Unbelievable.
<p>
<i>(August 15, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010815.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Knock on wood and cross your fingers, I think I'm on a roll here.  Three days in a row!
<p>
<i>(August 14, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010814.html">the toon</a>)<br>
That wacky Toonbot!
<p>
<i>(August 13, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010813.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Ahem, ahem.  I think maybe I'll just go onto a <i>regular</i> 16-day update schedule.  Yeah!
Anyway, it was coincidence.  Jetlag coming back from Europe, and then hanging in limbo waiting for
a seriously large, seriously late payment from my <a href="http://www.techspex.com">biggest
customer</a> and wondering how I'd pay the mortgage this month, and the health insurance, and
little things like that.
<p>
So I said, "oh hell with it," saw Scott Kurtz's Attack on the Attack of the Clones, and it gave me
a stupid idea, and I'd gotten four panels in, when FedEx knocked on the door with a really big
check.  Go figure.
<p>
Life is strange.
<p>
<i>(July 27, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010727.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Ahem.  16 days isn't my worst performance.  I've been busy, busy, busy.  I
wish I were less busy, but then I'd just find more work.  In non-Toonbots
news, I've decided not to get a doctorate after all, just do the research
instead.  When you have a business and kids and everything, something has to
give.  I'm hoping this isn't the wrong decision to make, but ultimately it's
the same decision I made in 1996, and I wasn't wrong.  And I <i>will</i>
continue to be associated with <a href="http://www.cogsci.indiana.edu">CRCC</a>
and Douglas Hofstadter, and that was what I really wanted all along.
<p>
Right?
<p>
But then in Toonbots-related news, I just now saw from my logs that I have
a completely gratuitous and unsolicited link from the <a href="http://www.polymer-city.com/">Polymer
City Chronicle</a>, a strip I've long admired (well, since I discovered it in June, anyway) for
its simply wonderful plot and wonderfully simple art style.  And just like that, he seems to have
discovered me at the same time!  (And along with strips like BoxJam's Doodle and Jackie's
Fridge, too -- heady company indeed!)
<p>
So I've got my ego boost for the day (which I needed after the doctoral decision)
and you have a new episode and <i>everbody's happy</i>!
<p>
<i>(July 11, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010711.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Woo-hoo!  I think I <i>like</i> fifth-wall humor!

Fifth-wall humor.  I kill me.
<p>
<i>(July Fourth, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010704.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Ah, Budapest.  I love it here.  And this year, getting here <i>was</i> half the fun, and a tip
of my hat to Cunard and the wonderful Queen Elizabeth II, including the wait staff of the Mauretania
Restaurant (by which you can see that we had just about the cheapest accomodations possible)
(but they were still luxurious).  The only real problem with Budapest, of course, is that they
don't explode things on the Fourth of July.  Just on August 20 and New Year's, neither of which
is today.  Poor benighted folk.
<p>
So anyway, my vacation was excellent, I really am feeling rejuvenated, some of it is liable to
slop over into new and strange Toonbots episodes.  Thanks for sticking with me in the meantime,
and of course, a <i>huge</i> thanks to Tirdun and the Communist Saga, all 20 episodes.
<p>
Y'know, I think that makes Tirdun Cool Enough, don't you?<br>

<p>
<i>(June 7, 2001)</i> (<a href="toon20010607.html">the toon</a>)<br>
Groan.  I'm trying to make time to extend the Toon-o-Matic, but ... ah, fugeddit.  You know the routine.  So we get another
episode of tripe instead of <i>wolverines</i>!  At least Tim Bram rocks with his VRML meta-fan art.
<p>
So this is the 61st episode of Toonbots, and I've been at it 259 days now.  That's just over 4.2 days per episode, so I'm doing better
than weekly, on average.  That's a comfort.  Incidentally, the Toonbots home page is just around 50 page views daily.  I don't know who
all you people are, but you probably should look into competent group therapy or something; may I recommend <a href="discuss.pl">the
Toonbots forum?</a>  They're wacky, our Jihad.

<li><strong><a href=reviews.html>Reviews of various Webtoons</a></strong><br>
I love the Webtoon phenomenon.  We're literally in a Golden Age of cartooning, right this very moment.  So, because I
love hearing myself talk, I've scribbled down some musings on a few of my favorites.  I'm resisting the urge to write
about the ones everybody already knows (like Sluggy Freelance and CRFH!!!) and instead I'm writing on the ones maybe you
haven't heard about.  With any luck, there will be more than just seven eventually.
<li><strong><a href=toon-o-matic.html>The Toon-o-Matic</a></strong><br>
If <a href=/linkout/www.choppingblock.org>Lee Herold</a> can draw with an Exacto knife and
a sponge, I figure I can draw with Perl.  Right?  Right.
<li><strong>Link to who?</strong><br>
What's that?  I could have sworn you said you wanted to link <i>to</i> Toonbots.  You did?  Wow.  People can be strange.
Well, if you're serious, you can use this graphic:<br><center><img src="banner.gif"></center><br>The XML is simple:<br>
