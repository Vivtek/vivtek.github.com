<P>OF COURSE napoleon was the penguins. it all fits together so well - the dreams of empire, the short stature, the formal wear - and napoleon spent all that time on islands, so even the fish craving thing makes sense. i knew it all along.

<P>Actually, while obviously Napoleon chose to pose as &quot;THE PENGUINS&quot; for a joke on this one occasion, she was pre-occupied when the &quot;invasion&quot; began. Recall her being mildly surprised when I brought the matter to her attention. Humble self has long suspected Michael, largely because of the swiftness in which &quot;THE PENGUINS&quot; received their own Jihad title and number ranking following their first post.

<P>No denying, a vacation or something like -is- in order. But I looked through the forum's recentness, anycase, and couldn't find any such denial, and ended up confused. Perhaps I just need to expand my searching. Perhaps he denied it in the Kspot fora, which I avoid nowadays and will continue so to do...

<P>I'm sure that's supposed to be a Boxjammian bird, whether or not it's been shown in the strip before. Not a guest character, and besides that, note the thickness of the marker strokes. The same as those used for BoxJam and Co. as opposed to the different line thicknesses used for the cameo characters, even Charlie Brown.

<BR>> Though he denies it (see latest comment to that thread.)
<P>Well, I'll take his word for it for the moment, but that aside, still doubtful that any hacking occurred. If Michael wasn't involved, presumably he would have noticed if his own board had been hacked in any way. Suppose he was just watching the board rather closely on that occasion, then, and as is his wont at times, he created a title for the pseudonymous personage. Disregarding Michael, Tirdun seems the most likely candidate, and he does have a history of using spoof identities on this board (notably Tammy Lewis, but a few others who I can't recall at the moment.) Even if he isn't or is reluctant to divulge any information in that regard, matters little at this point, the whole thing's over anyway.

<strong>Re: THERE IS NO NAPOLEON</strong>
<P>&gt; Well, I'll take his word for it for the moment, but that aside, still
<BR>> doubtful that any hacking occurred.
<P>What hacking? Somebody just started using a different name. I figured it's Tirdun because he does that sort of stuff, but I didn't really care, because it was funny. If I'd cared, I'd look at the posting IP and subpoena the ISP in question (and woe the hacker who hacks from work.) Because if it had been hacking, I would have been some odd mixture of pissed and interested.
<P>As for pseudonymous titlage, I just modified the summary.pl that writes the table to add the penguins' title to anybody posting with a name in ALL CAPS (Emsworth, you triggered it last night; check the list.) I thought people would find that funny, but I don't think anybody noticed. But it's there forever now, so we can have pleasant reminders in the months to come.
<P>(And I was referring to my quick post on your LiveJournal, Eric.)
<P>I hope this clears up all outstanding mystery surrounding the Penguin Episode, except for the actual identity of the waterfowl in question, who shall remain nameless. Except for Alex Trebec. Who made a pretty good penguin.

<P>my word, you all are chatty today. i hold with my assessment that it was, in fact, napoleon. i never seriously considered michael - he can be quick with a title when the mood strikes him, and that whole exchange was just too funny not to jump on. i did think he might have a better idea than he says he does about who it was.....this suggests the poster came from a widely used isp...(quick watson, the baedecker!) but the style of the messages (at least the first couple) - no, not quite him. emsworth has the skills to create something similar - but again, just not quite his style, i think. besides, there was a highly suspicious post on napoleon's forum (which i would cite, but i would have to go get the like, and it's too late to fight off popups). some of the later posts may have had other authors (and i agree, tirdun is a suspicious-looking character in this regard)
<P>anyway, whoever it(they) was(were), they were excellent posts, and it was a lot of fun.

<P>Napoleon responded *after* I'd informed her of the penguin thingummy and showed her a few of the messages. No doubt she merely wanted to encourage spinclad's undue paranoia for her own amusement. She hadn't had time to post to this board or any other boards at that period, lety alone assume an alternate identity.
<P>Agreed that it really matters little at this point who started it (though I notice that Col. Mustard, Raffles, and Prof. Moriarty have been curiously absent from the lists of suspects.)

<P>Not exactly omnipresent, though, just slightly ubiquitous in some areas. Besides, penguins in the media are hardly a new development. Take Walter Lantz' Chilly Willy, for example, or the 40's Bob Hope comedy &quot;My Favorite Spy,&quot; in which Bob's a vaudevillian with a trained penguin named Percy.

<P>It's still available for rental at many video stores, at least, and for awhile, Target had copies in their marked down video section for $5.99. The Motion Picture Guide sums it up with the following review:
<P>&quot;Thomas and Moranis bring their SCTV comedy skit to the big screen with an equal amount of vigor and beer. While many of their television sketches lasted only a couple of minutes, STRANGE BREW drags them out to an hour and a half. Bob and Doug McKenzie do all the things they have done on TV - wear toques and plaid shirts, pontificate while under the influence of cheap Canadian beer, and call each other &quot;hoseheads.&quot; No, there's nothing intellectual here- just a couple of likable fellows trying to stop power mad brewe Von Sydow from gaining control of the world. If you want intellect, go watch THE SEVENTH SEAL; von Sydow starred in that too, before he got big with Bob and Doug. Filmed in Hoserama.&quot;

<P>if it was really a hamlet parody, claude should have been her stepfather _and_ her uncle - hamlet had no other uncles. but a brewmeister sounds like a more in-charge kinda guy than polonius was - if it was about beer-making, the brewmeister _would_ be king. don't suppose he was hamlet's real father? although i guess someone would have mentioned if he appeared only as a ghost....
