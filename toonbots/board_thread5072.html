<strong>Matrix 3 - 10.0</strong>
<P>The perfect final installment to the trilogy. I just loved it. Moreover, my cousin's boyfriend is in the credits, since he did some software and/or graphics work (he's one of those Left Coast green-haired graphics types.)
<P>Good movie, and Hugo Weaving rulez.

<strong>Re: Matrix 3 - 10.0</strong>

<BR>> my cousin's boyfriend is in the credits, since he did some software and/or
<BR>> graphics work (he's one of those Left Coast green-haired graphics types.)
<P>lucky stiff - i always thought that would be a seriously cool thing to do. (of course, i have no artistic skill whatever, so that might slow my career some.) (actually, what i _really_ want to do is get in on some of the dinosaur animation the discovery channel does, because i still think they don't have quite the right thought process on working out how an animal of such-and-such a construction might actually move.)
<P>this was the one movie i saw over christmas, and i was quite satisfied with it. (although i will, of course, be looking to add the dvd to my new dvd collection, to see what they did to saruman). i think it drifts farther from the book than either of the others - but actually _seeing_ the ghost army in battle rather made up for that.
<P>saw somewhere that peter jackson is interested in tackling &quot;the hobbit&quot; as well - which would be majorly neat. can you imagine the smaug he would come up with?

<strong>make that 'RotK'</strong>
<P>which i retained from further up in the listings, and it is also the last of a trilogy and... michael, you gotta learn to be a _leetle_ more specific in your movie descriptions...
<P>(but it _does_ explain how your west-coast boyfriend of cousin ended up in the credits of a movie i figured was entirely done by new zealanders...)

<P>Both having Hugh Weaving added to the confusion, no doubt. I'll always remember him best for his dramatic portrayal of Rex the sheepdog in &quot;Babe,&quot; the original book of which was a childhood favorite.
<P>&gt; (but it _does_ explain how your west-coast boyfriend of cousin ended up in
<BR>> the credits of a movie i figured was entirely done by new zealanders...)
<P>For the record, no it wasn't. Computer animation being largely post prod anyway, so you had a range of animators, including one or two I believe that did work on &quot;The Matrix&quot; series and &quot;POTC.&quot; Some from Hawaii, who left when Square (producers of the Final Fantasy games) closed their movie division, some ex-ILM people I think... When I have time to finally finish reading the books and then see the movies, I'll say more.
<P>Or else I'll wait for the inevitable thorough credit list in British film journal Sight and Sound's February issue and analyze from there.

<P>Interesting you should bring that up, since unless I'm mistaken, and I might be as I lack cable and have been unable to buy the videos of any of the Discovery Channel's dinosaur specials or series (the new one is supposed to present the indosaurs as individual named characters, I think?), but I had a notion that they relied heavily on Dr. Stuart Sumida as a consultant for that series.
<P>If not, perhaps they should. http://animex.tees.ac.uk/speakers_full.cfm?speaker_id=4 The man has a great reputation as a paleontologist and animal anatomist, and as such has lectured at most of the major animation studios and been variously credited as &quot;Lion Anatomy Consultant&quot; for Lion King, &quot;Bird Anatomy Consultant&quot; for Stuart Little 2, &quot;Horse Anatomy Consultant&quot; for Spirit, &quot;Ape Anatomy Consultant&quot; for Tarzan, plus work on &quot;Dinosaur.&quot; His work in helping anaimators figure out the structure and probable realistic movements for Stitch in Lilo and Stitch and dragons in &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; was uncredited, I believe, no doubt to avoid the potential scandal of conspiracy theorists or the government wondering where Disney found aliens and dragons to dissect.
<P>&gt; saw somewhere that peter jackson is interested in tackling &quot;the
<BR>> hobbit&quot; as well - which would be majorly neat. can you imagine the
<BR>> smaug he would come up with?
<P>I still have trouble seperating Peter Jackson from &quot;Meet the Fleegles,&quot; which I never even sat through, just because of the images and plot synopsis, so I have a mental image of Smaug speaking like Miss Piggy and trying to seduce Bilbo.

<P>could be - i did see parts of the one you mention, and that one did seem better (although i didn't check out the credits). i was thinking about one a year or two ago, which had ichthyosaurs (which have vertically oriented tail fins, suitable for a side-to-side stroke) leaping out of the water while swimming like dolphins (which have horizontally oriented tail fins, giving them a natural up-and-down motion). and then the ichthyosaur came up to breathe _through_ _it's_ _mouth_ (one doesn't like to think what they thought the nostrils were for). so maybe someone else noticed, and refered them to dr. sumida.
<P>&gt; I still have trouble seperating Peter Jackson from &quot;Meet the
<BR>> Fleegles,&quot; which I never even sat through, just because of the images
<BR>> and plot synopsis, so I have a mental image of Smaug speaking like Miss
<BR>> Piggy and trying to seduce Bilbo.
<P>well, one _could_ think of smaug's attempts to lure bilbo into sight as a sort of seduction....but not quite that way. (and now i see a dragon with miss piggy's face, thank you very much)
