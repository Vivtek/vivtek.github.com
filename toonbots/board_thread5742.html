<strong>Emsworth the Educated</strong> <i>Thu Aug 11 11:54:54 2005</i><br>
<strong>*wolverines consume lengthy silences*</strong>
<P>Sorry, but believe me, the trip to Syracuse (four days to get here, and still unpacking) has been hard on the horde (say that three times fast). Poor Otu had to be used as padding next to the boxes of glass cooking implements. Godfrey was very peckish, though, and I now find four cooking knives are missing. I half expect to find the well gnawed handles laying around.
<P>Much discussion to come when time allows (lots to do on campus, don't have computer set up yet and even when I do, looks like I'll have to wait for Time Warner Roadrunner Devours Souls to install broadband cable). Why don't I stick with my bally dial-up? Because I also have to wait to install a phone!
<P>Notes to the Jihad- Michael: So, exactly where are you moving to or from *now*? This is why I could never get you those Wodehouse books! They sold out while I was waiting, though I did get two Jeeves (and now a gnarled coverless copy of Big Money, left by the Indian tenants who had the apartment before me, along with some garbage, x-rays, an Indian flag poster, and a pin-up).
<P>mouse: Check your mail! The package was sent off about a week or at least four days or so before we left, so it should be there.
<P>Jenn: Not sure when I'll be in your neck of the woods soloing, but Dad is hoping to come down in mid March (spring break) and see a show. He also wants more details about your thrilling costuming position! Will you receive credit in the playbills?
<P>Finally, some Toonbottiness:
<P>http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050314/conceptual.html
<P>This was posted a few months back, inspired by my own comments on Toonbots on the Modern Tales message boards.
<P>Finally, flipping through channels briefly while in a motel, I came across an ad on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block, for their website: &quot;Naked Toonbots Promotion.&quot; Apparently a game on the site involving Space Ghost and other characters. Michael? Do you know a good trademark infringement lawyer? I think you may have a case!

<P>it did! it has! it is! and everyday i tell myself &quot;i have _got_ to email emsworth and thank him&quot;...and then i don't. but it is here, and the book looks great, and the wodehouse is next up on my reading list - and pitstop penelope and the bunny are up on a shelf, where kitten can't get them. (i have recently acquired a kitten, to keep cat company - and she accounts for a lot of my distraction and shortness of time). (also for the number of things now living on high shelves.)
<P>glad everyone survived the move. i'm sure a little alka-seltzer will settle all stomachs (regardless of contents), and otu will soon get the kinks out running around the new place.

<strong>It can't have been 18 days since I checked here!</strong>
<P>...if you consider the name of the shop I work for as being credit, then Yes! I'll be all over!
<P>We're doing Rigolletto now.

<P>Damn if I know. I'll tell you when I get there. We may not even move. But it's looking an awful lot like back to the Caribbean again.

<P>A teeny little ego stroke.

<P>No. Sigh.

<P>Or not. Current probability of staying here for a while: about 70%, with only 30% probability of missing winter again. Sigh.
