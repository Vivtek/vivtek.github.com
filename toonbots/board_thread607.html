<P>You know, I'd better go check the counts on older threads. It would be quite embarassing if this thread caused another to die and killed my post count.

<P>That's what you get for spamming up the board just to maintain your position. :P

<P>Sorry. For me, &quot;pole position&quot; evokes nothing but the 500 itself. (Recall I'm from Indiana.) I.e. a lot of really groovy noise, building tension, &quot;Lady and gentlemen, start your engines&quot; and there's no moment in the year just quite like that. They go around on the pace lap, you think, boy, those cars are moving pretty fast. Then they start to race. And you realize that until that moment, you haven't seen fast. You forget, from year to year. Yeah, a jet liner technically goes faster, but it's not that close. The Indy cars are just way faster than anything actually on the ground has a right to be.
<P>Man. It brings a tear to my eye, even in January. And I'm not really into it even.

<P>I remember I got to visit the track once, when a couple-three cars were practicing or whatever... no doubt they weren't going anywhere near as fast as they would be during the Big Race, but I still didn't feel terribly safe being anywhere within a half-mile radius of those things. I agree: nothing has a right to go that fast unless it's way up in the air where such things don't matter quite so much.

<P>I assume you mean _The_ Track, not just one of those cheap knockoffs, right?
<P>The race is magnificent.
