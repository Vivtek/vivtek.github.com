<strong>Outside Opinions on Toonbots</strong>
<P>
<P>I've been rather curious as to what others outside the jihad think of Toonbots, and to that end, have been plugging it in my signature over in &quot;The Class Menagerie&quot; forum and the other few Keenspot forums I freuent (at least, whenever I remember to check the signature box.) I found out who had visited the site from my signature, one Eric Schissel, prominent poster to several forums in Keenspot and a few in Keenspace, but who does have some interest in Perl. I asked him what he thought of it, and the following was his opinion:
<P>&quot;As to Toonbots, I checked it out a few days back. Mixed feelings since indeed for the most part I am drawn towards less &quot;abstract,&quot; more character- and plot-driven work, but definitely fun getting to know, and I shall be checking back from time to time. I have always been interested in computer-generated music at least in principle, to give a parallel example, though not always in the results, where my tastes are perhaps somewhat more dry, favoring a musical logic with roots in a counterpoint of traceable (even if heavily metamorphosed, as in Sorabji and Holmboe) themes.&quot;
<P>Not exactly a glowing recommendation, but by no means a bad critique, probably a fairly good idea of what the average individual might think, and he did say he'll probably be checking back occasionally.

<P>Well, Eric may be cool enough to be maintainer of an open-source package, but hey -- not all cool people are cool enough to appreciate minimalist humor, you know.
<P>Hopefully in the coming months there will be more for Eric to like. I don't much care for the plotlessness myself. If I weren't writing Toonbots, I wouldn't visit it daily. But the art, for me, is the Toon-o-Matic. The strip is a byproduct. Much like hot dogs.

<P>(audible chuckling) I'll have to find a way of using that in my signature; perhaps a quote from the author, or something. Hopefully it will grab more attention. I'm glad Mr. Schissel looked at it, but I know some of those people, judging from their posts, have unusual senses of humor, or unusual tastes in general, and would probably find this funny.
<P>I do hope next time Mr. Schissel looks at it, though, that he'll say what he thinks in this forum. I feel slightly uncomfortable quoting him like that, and I'd also like to know if and how his opinion changed. I really am curious as to what others think of this, if only to ally my concerns that my fascination with Toonbots could be a sign of mental instability.

<P>Well, I wouldn't hold my breath on that one, personally.
