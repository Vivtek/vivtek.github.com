<strong>Request for Comments</strong>
<P>I just read back over the archives from April on, and really, this strip is starting to read a little bit like a strip. It's not as disjoint as it was last year. So my question is: is this a good thing? The continuity helps, doesn't it? Even if it's weird continuity?
<P>Is it better having a daily dose of shorter strips, like I've been doing last week and this week, or was it better every few days with a longer, more standalone episode, like back in February or so?
<P>Does anybody even care, once they're hooked on Toonbots? Maybe certain critical circuits are disabled by the addiction?
<P>I'd also like to comment that Jenn and Napoleon are not only posting at nearly identical rates, they're also overtaking Tirdun. Interesting. Also, gopher appears as yet not dead.

<BR>> critical circuits are disabled by the addiction?
<P>Yeah, that's about it... since the continuity doesn't even pretend to be what would normally be considered a &quot;storyline,&quot; pretty much the only difference between continuity strips and one-shots is if the characters remember what happened last time. It doesn't really matter which is used more.
<P>However, if more one-shots does mean a more frequent dose of Toonbots, then I'm all for that.
<P>&gt; I'd also like to comment that Jenn and Napoleon are not only posting at
<BR>> nearly identical rates, they're also overtaking Tirdun. Interesting. Also,
<BR>> gopher appears as yet not dead.
<P>Perhaps Jenn is just a figment of Napoleon's imagination which is being used to subtly increase her post count in a manner that is totally excessive, yet can't get her defenestrated.

<strong>Re: Request for Comments</strong>
<P>Ooooh! I have an opinion! Sometimes when a joke builds on itself over a series of episodes, it makes it a lot more funny cause of the background. I see the strip moving through natural growth cycles. The beginning, where we were introduced to the characters and they explored their interactions with each other. Then once they got comfortable, the humor branched into subtler aspects. And now there's the familiar toonbots, with a history, that keeps surprising us in new and different ways. I think it's a normal progression to now have jokes that build on themselves.
<P>&gt; However, if more one-shots does mean a more frequent dose of Toonbots,
<BR>> then I'm all for that.
<P>Me, too! After all, the intravenous slurpies really only quell my withdrawal symptoms so much. And a jittery Jihad wannabe is a dangerous Jihad wannabe. Probably.
<P>&gt; Perhaps Jenn is just a figment of Napoleon's imagination which is being
<BR>> used to subtly increase her post count in a manner that is totally
<BR>> excessive, yet can't get her defenestrated.
<P>As a side note, Gopher sent me a real live Jihad membership card, so I say he can take a hiatus if he wants. Maybe I'll post in his name so he won't be sad when he gets back.
<P>Has anyone else noticed the extreme lack of respect I continue to get here? Come on, guys! There's that Drooling Fan Girl who's newer than me, go haze her!
<P>*goes and stands in the corner with Rodney Dangerfield...sheesh!*

<strong>Re: Request for Comments</strong>
<P>I think you've had a good balance of one-shot's and short arcs. I'm a big fan of story, but hey, it's toonbots. So if there's a lucid thread between some of the strips and BANG a one shot Seuss-a-thon, so be it. Now, if you wanted to add some predictability to the updates, THAT'd be a change I'd marvel at.
<P>Oh, and Jenn, we treat you like the newbie because you've darn near taken over the forum. It's not that you're the NEWEST, it's that your the most vocal of the new Jihad members :)

<P>Besides. I wouldn't have so much to say if you all weren't so darn entertaining! I blame the wolverines.

<P>Ahem. Technically, apart from Michael, gopher was the individual who dominated this board when it first began (and probably will again, in the fullness of time.) Tirdun clained to have overlooked the forum at the time (matter of fact, even I posted here a day before he did.) It's really only in comparatively recent months that Tirdun has become increasingly prolific on this forum.

<P>Ah. Well. You know, I did read the archived forum. I just can't /remember/ the archived forum. And besides, had I done the research necessary to be accurate, it wouldn't have allowed me to tease Tirdun quite so effectively. And really, what is veracity in the face of teasing Tirdun?

<P>Ahem. Veracity is an antihistamine concept, you know. Not to be sneezed at, and such. Can't always claim to be entirely accurate myself (and made an embarrassing blunder on occasion), but it never hurts to try, you know.
