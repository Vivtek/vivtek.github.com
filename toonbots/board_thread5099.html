<strong>Eating Bambi</strong>
<P>Mmmm. This weekend when we visited, my Dad gave us some venison somebody had shot on his property and given him half of. I made spaghetti sauce out of it. It was mm, mm, good.
<P>Almost makes up for falling on the ice on his porch. The best I can say for that is, I don't think I cracked a rib. Saying about any event that you don't think you cracked a rib says a whole lot about that event.
<P>Anyway, that's the news from red-state Indiana. Some of that red-state stuff I really like. Like venison spaghetti bolognese.

<strong>Re: Eating Bambi</strong>
<P>oddly enough, even as i am reading that, i am eating barley buffalo stew.
<P>unfortunately, i had to buy the buffalo...
<P>and at this point, i'm beginning to think cracked ribs might not be that bad a deal. i seem to have tweaked my neck this weekend (while reading, yet) - and the pain has been amusing itself by moving up and down my back all week. at least with cracked ribs, you have some hope that they will eventually _heal_.

<P>Unfortunately it wasn't my ribs. It was a very pulled muscle. Thursday and Friday I had back spasms. Back spasms are something I'd heard of but somehow never really thought about how truly painful they must be.
<P>They are.
<P>Really.

<strong>Re: Eating Bambi</strong>
<P>oooo *sympathetic wince* i've had those.
<P>you know, they tell you at the gym that your back is important in all the things you do, yadda yadda yadda - but you don't really appreciate that fact until *every* *single* *fricking* move you make hurts in new and interesting ways....
<P>hope you recover soon.

<P>Oh, how true that is.

<P>Yeah, me too. It's improved greatly since last week, but I sneezed this morning and it was just like a knife in my side. Well. I've never actually had a knife in my side, but it's just like I imagine a knife in my side might feel.
