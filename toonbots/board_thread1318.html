<strong>I've been promoted</strong>
<P>It seems that my transition from Arch-uberbischoff to Arch-uberpopenschnitzel (you may kiss the ring) has gone off without a hitch, many thanks to Michael. The adoring crowds may be a bit much right now, but they'll die down after a while. Now, for my first act as Arch-uberpopenschnitzel (you may kiss the ring), I'm going to claim this wolverine as my own (grrrr) ah... from a distance. That one, with the stripes. Right. (grrrr) nevermind. As my first act as Arch-uberpopenschnitzel, (you may kiss the ring) I will submit for sanctity my XML fan art. It's not canon, of course, as nothing can be canon that is not of he that is Michael, but as he that is Michael has run it through the oh-so holy and recently updated with fonts Toon-O-Matic, and it being the first to have such a great honor, it is deserving of high praise. You! Over there. Praise it. Now! NOW! Come on! Please?!? But I'm the Arch-uberpopenschnitzel (you may kiss the ring)!! Blast. Does this come with ANY perks?

<P>None that we've been able to identify as yet.
<P>But *I* was quite impressed with your fan XML.

<P>Shoot.

<P>I was impressed at just how horrifing it looked before you fixed it. I am still just a lowly XML apprentice.

<P>It was just a sizing question; you got height and width reversed, and the row format made it worse. I'd say for a coding effort with no documentation and no opportunity to debug, it was damned good. Believe me, I get the occasional mutant episode, too. I'm not just the metacartoonist, I'm a customer.
