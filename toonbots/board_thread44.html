<strong>Post!</strong>
<P>Where are all the people. Only 4 people have posted so far, Michael and I account for about 80% of all posts here. Come on, let's see how many it takes to break Michael's perl script!

<P>Ok, aparently no on reads this forum, either. Or maybe everyone lives on the west coast and sleeps 'till noon. Wake up! Lazy Californians.

<P>It's pathetic, isn't it? And this is *after* you and Tirdun were chased out of Lee's forum.

<P>No one was chased out of anywhere. Well, I mean, I *tried*, but they wouldn't leave. There was some 'David Shea' guy hanging around for a bit, but I *did* manage to get rid of that loser. I'm glad, however, that gopher didn't leave.

<P>Yeah! Drive that David Shea person out. Don't let him steal gopher's good name! *grumble grumble forget one lousy word in the sig...*

<strong>Re: Post!</strong>
<P>Pardon me, but I do read the strip and even the forum, oddly enough. I really haven't had much to say. There are a number of strips I read, and whose forums I read as well, but I usually don't post unless I'm particularly interested in a topic, really have something to say, or am particularly bored. Certain boards are more active than others for natural reasons. Serial strips are more apt to stimulate speculation and analysis. Other forums remain active because they develop an atmosphere of their own, often quiet different from the strip and at times only tenuously connected to the strip. &quot;CRFH&quot; is the most notorious forum of this kind, and certainly the most frightening and intimidating. However, even the forums for &quot;Boxjam's Doodle&quot; and &quot;Chopping Block,&quot; while making for entertaining if unusual and occasionally disturbing reading, may be a trifle intimidating for the average, timid comic reader. And then there's some who already spend too much time posting to message boards, and are reluctant to start with another.
<P>Well, regarding Toonbots. Rather liked the flag yesterday (so far, only Toonbots, Ozy and Millie, and Kevina and Kell, to the best of my knowledge, ran politically themed strips yesterday.)
<P>&gt; Wake up! Lazy Californians.
<P>For the record, I'm a Texan (well, I had no choice in the matter.)
<P>Ahem, well, that's all I have to say at the moment. Awaiting the next precious Perl of wisdom and humor, and farwell for now.
<P>

<P>Chopping Block, too. Butch votes for pro-lifers.

<P>Well, I'd have to pump water *out* to be swamped at this point. I see now that last week was just the calm before the storm. So don't hold your breath -- but on the other hand, I guess people who hold their breath waiting for Toonbots have mostly asphyxiated by now.
<P>Think of it as evolution in action.

<strong>Oh. That makes sense.</strong>
<P>I'm glad to know that I'm that the only person who shows up here every day. I suppose I'm still the most rabid fan, since not having anything to say doesn't stop me from posting. Oh well.

<P>Le'see, Supersoity had some commentary on George W., The Mr. Chuck Show did a voting strip, and Greystone Inn had Nader as a guest star. Most did seem to actively avoid the matter, however. And the rest are done by non-US'ians.
