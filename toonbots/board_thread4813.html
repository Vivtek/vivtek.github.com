<strong>Darn good new toon</strong>
<P>That line couldn't beg harder to be put in a toon if it TRIED.
<P>In a somewhat similar vein, courtesy of Fark:

<P>--
<P>Tokyo - A Japanese minister said on Friday that the parents of a boy suspected of kidnapping and killing a young child should be &quot;beheaded.&quot;
<P>[...]
<P>&quot;The parents should be dragged through the streets and then beheaded,&quot; said Yoshitada Konoike, state minister in charge of deregulation zones and disaster management. &quot;Then parents and their children would be more careful.&quot;
<P>[...]
<P>Konoike later said the comments were a &quot;just a metaphor&quot; drawn from samurai movies and explained he meant parents should take responsibility when their children break the law.
<P>--
<P>Sure, sure, we believe you...

<P>i love it when politicians speak without a script - what is this going to teach the children to be more careful of? what kind of parents they have?

<P>Oh gods, it strikes again. An *unofficial* North Korean spokesweirdo (from the &quot;Centre for Korean-American Peace&quot; no less) has told the Australian government, in somewhat broken English, that if it joins a WMD blockade operation, they can and will launch nuclear missiles against the country.
<P>&quot;The North Korean message is to be careful in talking,&quot; Mr Myong-Chol said. &quot;Otherwise, harm to Australia.&quot;

<P>i figured it was political retardation _year_ - or maybe decade...
<P>although the koreans _do_ seem to have practical ideas on achieving peace - after all, once you obliterate your enemy, they tend to be pretty peaceful.
<P>on the home front, a capitol hill scandal involving a senatorial intern named tripplehorn, who broke up with his girlfriend via e-mail (which e-mail was apparently then forwarded over all the known universe). in it he expresses the following tender sentiments:
<P>&quot;I was planning on ruining your career by making phone calls to all of my parents [sic] friends and have you blackballed from the workplace as well as every prestigous [sic] law school in the country, but then (lucky for you) I decided not to do that because you are a sad sad person and I will just let your life self destruct right before my eyes...I am sorry, I don't care how big of [a] sadistic [expletive] crush you have on me but people like me simple [sic] don't date people like you.&quot;
<P>he was promptly fired by the senator, but has since been hired by a republican congressman...doubtless one of those &quot;compassionate conservatives&quot;.

<P>I saw that thing. Were there any particularly good parts? I got about as far as that paragraph that you posted before I hit the limit of my tolerance for grammatical errors and run-on sentences. One would think that someone working for a senator would at least be able to write a coherent break-up message.

<P>this was all that was quoted in the little news-blurb i saw - you mean he went on longer than that? what a dork....his ex-girlfriend is probably relieved she's _not_ &quot;someone like him&quot;.

<P>linky: http://www.snopes.com/computer/internet/tripplehorn.asp
<P>So in the second paragraph he starts off by complaining how competitive she is, continued, in the same sentence, by an assertation that he has more friends and always will. Blah blah blah-blah blah, you suck, look how very rich I am, stop complaining about how very rich I am (he at least used two sentences this time), and then the big paragraph. The big one is about half the email, and it appears to say more of the same, but with more words this time. So yeah, he's quite the charmer.

<P>And oddly enough, it happenbed to be an intern with one of my state senators, who in fact is currently supporting UTEP as we appeal to get the McNair Scholars program re-instated on campus. Glad she had the good sense to let him go (especially since I'm reasonably certain that I probably in all likelihood voted for her, though it was awhile ago.)

<strong>Re: or, we could us it for the name of the century</strong>
<P>for some reason the name 'kay bailey hutchison' just _sounds_ like it belongs to a nice person - although of course i know virtually nothing about her - but i'm willing to think positively just because of her name (how's _that_ for a completely illogical political viewpoint?) and as a woman, she probably felt more than a little sympathy for the girlfriend.

<P>This reminds me of something that's been puzzling me since I think yesterday afternoon sometime. Someone I know who was watching CNN said the North and South Koreans were shooting at each other. I turned it on and caught the tail end of a report to that effect (before they went and started interviewing Pat Robertson about his latest loony idea[1]) ... but I haven't seen anything further on it since. Not from cnn.com or news.bbc.co.uk or ANYWHERE. Very strange.
<P>[1] He wants a third of the Supreme Court to retire due to age and/or infirmity, and along the way managed to take second-hand credit for the collapse of the USSR.

<P>i saw something about that - apparently it was just a 'minor' exchange of machine-gun fire. one of those little across-the-dmz spats - nothing to worry about at all. all fine. everything's going to be fine (*curling up in a small ball and rocking in a comforting manner*)
<P>i am going to restrain myself from commenting on administrations who feel they have to manufacture evidence of nuclear weapons to go to war against nasty people, when there are nasty people already trumpeting that they _have_ nuclear weapons.

<P>well, i have no problem with a third of the court retiring - if i wasn't so frightened about who would replace them (somehow, i suspect pat and i have different opinions on that). guess i shouldn't think mean thoughts about him, though, since he handled that whole ussr thing.....
