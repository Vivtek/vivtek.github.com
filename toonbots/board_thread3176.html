<strong>just a few minor small tiny questions...</strong>
<P>about today's 'toon:
<P>1) wasn't this conglomerate d&amp;_m_ in the previous advert? is d&amp;g a new entity? or were you perchance intimidated into disguising d&amp;m's identity in a metafictional plotline? (it's ok, michael - we all know what their lawyers are like)
<P>2) not to get personal or anything....but are those earring? or does napoleon have unusually pointy and/or floppy ears? (or maybe she's wearing her spock ears upside down?...no, no, of course not)
<P>sorry, been doing some editing - hard to shake the nitpicking.
<P>glad we are back off track.

<strong>Re: just a few minor small tiny questions...</strong>
<P>on careful review of the toons in questions, it seems d&amp;m and d&amp;g _are_ seperate companies: d&amp;m produces rolled ants (presumably smoked or to be smoked) while d&amp;g appears to be composed of 'smoking insects' (presumably insects which (who?) smoke, doubtless (from the plotline) in a sinister and conspiratorial fashion)
<P>ooh, ooh -- does this mean the takeover was engineered by the csa? (cigarette-smoking ant?)
<P>THE TOON IS OUT THERE

<P>thenkyew - it does work on several levels (although it occurred to me after i posted it - if you only get pbs, do you know anything of the x-files?)

<P>You can't inhabit the Internet without picking up *some* things. Like &quot;The Truth is Out There.&quot; Mayberry Melonpool did a riff on it, at the least. And it's only been about three years, anyway -- since we moved to this house.
<P>But we're Trekkies. X-Files somehow never really clicked for me. I think I've seen about one episode.

<P>well, so much for the CSA. i keep watching it (although this year not so much - doggett and what's-her-name are no mulder and scully) despite the fact that it has really bad science (including stunningly basic errors in existing science) which really makes me insane.
<P>still, it does work well as something to parody.

<P>If you will permit me an Emsworthism: &quot;Dash it all!&quot; I even noticed the error and corrected it -- to D&amp;H. Sigh. And it *was* D&amp;M. I considered doing some sort of riff on the error, indeed something like intimidation, and couldn't make it gell.
<P>But you've gelled it for me, mouse. Of *course* they didn't intimidate LENIN -- that wouldn't make sense -- they intimidated the METACARTOONIST! I'll leave it as D&amp;H and go with that. Hee, hee. I'm glad I have you people. It makes some of this a lot easier.
<P>(If you're confused, mouse, about still seeing &quot;D&amp;G&quot;, it's because you need to reload the image in your browser cache; different browsers have different ways of doing that, or you can just ignore the difference and realize you're one of the few people still seeing &quot;D&amp;G&quot; instead of &quot;D&amp;H&quot;. Sort of a metajoke.)

<P>d&amp;h wouldn't surely wouldn't intimidate you- aren't they the sugar people?

<P>drat - no, now i see d&amp;h - of course, i am now on a different computer, so it has no cached copy -
<P>which reminds me- i've been meaning to ask (since you are the Source of All Internet Knowledge, at least for me) - sometimes i will go to a site that i have NEVER EVER BEEN TO BEFORE - and i will get some sort of message about not being able to connect to the site - then at the bottom it says 'Using previously cached version', and when i hit 'ok' the page will come up. so if i have never been to that site before - how can i have a previously cached version?
