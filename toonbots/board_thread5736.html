<strong>Broadway does dead communists!</strong>
<P>This just in, Toonbotians!
<P>This intrepid member of the Jihad was delerious to discover that the woman circulating with a piece of paper at work was taking down which night we'd like to go see the musical we finished doing the costumes for just before I started.
<P>I was certain it was a cosmic sign about Toonbots when I heard it was Lenin: The Musical! (though...frankly...didn't seem like good material for a musical)
<P>You can imagine my disappointment upon glancing at the paper and finding that it is actually Lennon: The Musical.

<strong>German film does dead communists!</strong>
<P>&gt; This just in, Toonbotians!
<P>&gt; This intrepid member of the Jihad was delerious to discover that the woman
<BR>> circulating with a piece of paper at work was taking down which night we'd
<BR>> like to go see the musical we finished doing the costumes for just before
<BR>> I started.
<P>&gt; I was certain it was a cosmic sign about Toonbots when I heard it was
<BR>> Lenin: The Musical! (though...frankly...didn't seem like good material for
<BR>> a musical)
<P>&gt; You can imagine my disappointment upon glancing at the paper and finding
<BR>> that it is actually Lennon: The Musical.
<P>Since apparently though there's been no discussion of the film Good Bye Lenin here since its release a couple of years back, though may I recommend it? It's more or less about a woman who on waking from a coma, needs to be convinced that the world is as it was when she went under it - and that was before the Berlin Wall went down. (Actually, there are other reasons why she needs to be convinced and there is much else to the story, but I don't want to go into it here. Just to say that it's detailed, well-plotted, not predictable, well-acted, in my opinion... this is not a review to be read after viewing, I'd have trouble writing that two years after I saw it anyway. Though I'm considering seeing it again at any rate.)
<P>Eric

<P>well, evita got a musical, the french revolution did - even sweeney todd. lenin should be a cinch.

<P>now, see, this strikes me as duller....i mean, you _know_ what the music is going to be.

<strong>oh dear.....</strong>
<P>just read a review of &quot;lennon: the musical&quot;: http://theater2.nytimes.com/2005/08/15/theater/reviews/15lenn.html
<P>it doesn't mention the costumes.
<P>on the other hand, given the general tone of the review, this is probably a _good_ thing.
