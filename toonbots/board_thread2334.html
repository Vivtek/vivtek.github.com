<strong>This bit doesn't make sense</strong>
<P>From Wired:
<P>In Florida, Bush was reading to children in a classroom at 9:05 a.m. when his chief of staff, Andrew Card, whispered into his ear. The president briefly turned somber before he resumed reading. He addressed the tragedy about a half-hour later.
<P>...
<P>Isn't that an odd reaction?

<strong>Re: This bit doesn't make sense</strong>
<P>I haven't seen film of that - did he say anything to Card? Maybe he was waiting for more info, or for preparations to be made to leave. I'm not sure I could have kept my voice straight to keep reading after news like that - but I don't know exactly how much they knew at that time. 9:05 might have been before the second plane hit, and was definitely before the Pentagon was hit.
<P>My nasty cynical side wonders if Bush still thinks &quot;every day is a great day when you're President&quot; (or whatever exactly it was he said).

<P>My paranoid redneck side is wondering if he knew about it. I think that's probably a leetle far-fetched. But fun to think about!

<strong>Re: This bit doesn't make sense</strong>
<P>doubt it though. he wants something to justify his missile shield -- this just points out the huge gaping holes in his 'defense against terrorist attacks'.

<P>Yeah, but he wants to be a war President like Daddy.
<P>Nah, he didn't know about it. But I'll bet he's happy *something* will get him into the history books.

<strong>Re: This bit doesn't make sense</strong>
<P>oh, I think he was already headed for a prominent place in history - as most disastrous fool ever elected.
<P>(now mouse, be nice)
<P>ok - as the man who set the standards for MBA ignorance on economic realities and what a joke a college degree is, compared to having the right relatives.
<P>(mouse......)
<P>ok, ok -- as the Amazing Time-Traveling Let's-Turn-Back-The-Clock Presidento!
<P>*sigh*

<P>I also doubt it, but if he did, it makes all those comparisons to Pearl Harbor that I keep hearing somewhat ironic to my ears, considering. -Eric Schissel
