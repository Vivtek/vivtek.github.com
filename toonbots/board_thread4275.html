<P>ha! i _knew_ you'd posted before!
<P>actually everyone who posts here gets counted (except, as you say, michael) - you will note even THE PENGUINS are there, and they are certainly without honor. so yes, by posting you become one of us. (so there!)

<P>&gt;Yes, I have...but it was under false pretenses. I was looking for information, had no idea about any of these toonbots..which, I have read some of, and I, um...think I qualify as being &quot;cool enough&quot;

<strong>Re: hmmm</strong>
<P>Please note that it is by joining those without honour that you join such as us.
<P>Further, that should the archives still bear the seeming of sense among their marks, then you may not yet have your Sense organ fully crispy. It is when Nakht begins to read equiclever with #strikethrough# HOORAY!!! #/# that you may know without knowing that you are 'cool enough'. (and naturally in no way fodder for the UNTITLED ARMED PANGOLIN FRONT. because there isn't any.)
<P>Unlike me. But then it's priors' privilege to keep setting the bar higher.

<P>Okay, after reading this..maybe i should re-think my cool-ness..or, if it as you say. I am definitely cool enough.

YOU SHALL HAVE TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR SECONDS BUT WE SHALL EAT ALL THE FISH AND JELLO THAT WE CAN WIGGLE DOWN OUR GULLET AND WE SHALL PUT FAR MORE UPON OUR PLATE THAT WE COULD EVER EAT BOTH IN THE AFOREMENTIONED SEAFOOD BUFFET SENSE AND AS A GENERAL METAPHOR FOR OUR WORLD DOMINATION AND ALL THE SPOILS THAT IT SHALL RESULT IN.

<P>THERE IS NO UNITED ARMED PENGUIN FRONT TO WHICH YOU COULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTANCE OF. WE DO NOT WASH ANY BRAINS WITH OUR COMPLEX SUBLIMINALPHACODE POSTS SO AS TO WEAKEN THE RESOLVE OF THE WORLD AND WE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PROTRACTED HIATUS OF ANY ONLINE COMICS IN QUESTION NOR HAVE WE ENLISTED THE AID OF ANY OTHER ARCTIC CREATURES IN ANY GLOBAL COOLING PLOT. YOUR ASSOCIATION WITH THE POWERFUL MOUSE WITH WHOM WE HAVE BATTLED VIA WITS BEFORE HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE GREAT BOOK OF FRIENDS AND FOES WITH VERY LARGE, VERY BOLD PRINT AND PERHAPS EVEN A FEARSOME UNDERLINE. HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE UNDERLINE AND MAHAP, YES, EVEN AN ASTERIC WILL DENOTE TO OUR BRETHEREN IN THE NEAR FUTURE JUST WHO MOST STOOD AGAINST OUR CAUSE. MANY HAVE BEEN MARKED IN THE BOOK OF THE UNITED ARMED PENGUIN FRONT WHICH DOES NOT EXIST AS ALREADY STATED BUT REPEATED FOR EMPHASIS.

<P>just for the record: 1) honor doesn't come in gobs. 2) gobs don't flow. 3) i wouldn't pay for _firsts_ of your nasty raw-fish buffet. 4) if you don't exist, how can you dominate the world? 5) look, up there! it's a plane! keep your eyes on it, now!

<P>brunothebandit.com - check on the forum for 'antarius'. (but don't tell him you know me) (or that you've even heard of me) (in fact, keep rodents out of your conversation altogether)
