<strong>April 14</strong>
<P>Well, first of all, there's a glaring grammar mistake in today's blurb. Should be &quot;...the modality strongly *evocative* of&quot; rather than &quot;strongly evocation of.&quot; Apart from that, nice to see more of Mao. Hope to see Tirdun's fan submissions debugged in the near future, though (How long, on average, does it take to debug those things, anyway?) The orange speech font is nice.
<P>Not much more to say at the moment, except that my final physical therapy session is scheduled for Tuesday, and I'll be gradually easing off of the cane.

<strong>woo-hooo!</strong>
<P>new toonbots! and the standings board is back! (not that i noticed it was gone). but no more jenn.....in her honor, i actually made a green jello mold this weekend (with pineapple tidbits in fun astronomic shapes!) - btw -- anyone know how you actually get those silly things _out_ of the mold, in approximately one piece?
<P>&gt; I'll be gradually easing off of the
<BR>> cane.
<P>i don't know - it seems to have finally persuaded michael to do a toon :p
<P>seriously, glad you are doing better.
<P>and hope everyone recovers from your various diseases.

<P>Hmm... Been awhile since I've used a Jell-O mold (most of ours were eventually thrown away, I believe.) Using slightly warm water to loosen the mold may help.
<P>&gt; i don't know - it seems to have finally persuaded michael to do a toon :p
<P>Haaaa! Didn't even notice the ambiguity in that statement! ::pokes Michael even more sharply with his cane::
<P>&gt; seriously, glad you are doing better.
<P>Many thanks.

<P>i put a warm wet towel around it, but only the bottom came out, then just part of the top. seem to recall something about oiling the mold, but the concept of greasy jello is ...well, even less appetizing than regular jello.
<P>&gt; Haaaa! Didn't even notice the ambiguity in that statement! ::pokes Michael
<BR>> even more sharply with his cane::
<P>that'll learn him!
<P>&gt; Many thanks.
<P>most welcome.
