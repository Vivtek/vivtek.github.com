<P>How you all feel about lurkers? Because ever since I found this place I have been lurking here, I dont know why, I just do it. I personally cant stand lurkers, thus my post now, trying to un-lurk.

<P>What on earth do you have against lurkers? There's nothing wrong with reading a public forum and not really caring to post at any given time. I do it myself on most forums I follow. (with this being one of the exceptions, of course)

<P>&gt;I dont really know, I guess I am just anal. Could be that I like to know who is reading what I write. Glad to know you dont mind it though, because I have been lurking here for some strange reason.

<strong>Re: just wondering</strong>
<P>actually the only think i have against lurkers is times like this when things is quiet and you can't get a conversation started - i always figure it's just that there's noone there, so it's a bit unnerving to find out that there really _are_ people there, they just aren't saying anthing. although i can see where this might be an intimidating forum to just jump into. myself, i just can't seem to stop myself from saying something (once i realized there really wasn't much anyone could do about me saying stuff) so i more or less only read fora i post in. and besides, you have posted here before, haven't you? so now you have no excuses.
<P>now about this 'strange reason' you've been lurking here.....

<P>no no no - don't worry about _that_. when he starts siccing the wolverines on you, _then_ you worry.
<P>no, i would characterize toonbots as a sort of 'strange attractor' - as you can see by the strange people it attracts. no brainwashing involved (just don't eat the jello) (especially not the one with anchovies)

<P>The wolverines performed their duty some time ago, when the archly antagonistic arctic avians first manifested themselves. Had little in the way of long-term effects, obviously and alas.

<P>::Otu purrs cutely at mouse before running off to play with ladybugs::
<P>First off, while I, in my position as official wolverine wrangler, (and on rare occasions, Napoleon, as proxy wrangler and wolverine breeder), have been known to &quot;sic&quot; the wolverines on infidels and whatnot, the wolverines are an endearingly free-spirited lot, and thus not all of their activities are by any means at my suggestion or command (such as those occasions when they've attempted to demolish the foundations of the forum.) And if there had been any malice aforethought in a presumed command to the delightfully ravenous horde, they would have mauled and devoured, rather than merely gnawing.
<P>
