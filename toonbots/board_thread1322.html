<strong>Amazing</strong>
<P>It's truly amazing that you're all still around after my dismal update performance of the last two months. You're all obviously a couple dogs short of a full pack, but you're a magnificent Jihad. Now that the Toon-o-Matic is back to (nearly) full functionality, I really hope to be able to get onto a more normal update schedule -- for me, this means from one to three days between, instead of (say) sixteen days. I just need ellipses now and I'm back in the black. Well, except I can't rotate text yet. But that'll come soon enough and it's not really all that critical.
<P>There is a majordomo list now for auto (or almost auto) notification; feel free to tell me if you want on it (I don't have autosignup enabled, due to a turf war between sendmail and majordomo for directory permissions; it's a long and sordid story and I won't bore you with it.) If it's good enough for Emsworth, it's good enough for you. Or you can continue to click obsessively every day in the hope that I got an extra five frickin minutes to draw an episode.
<P>Of course, if you *really* wanted more Toonbots, you'd come over here and babysit my kids while my wife and I went to the movies once in a while. This might not lead to more Toonbots, but I'd be happier.
<P>On second thought, I'm not sure if I'd really trust a Toonbots fan with my kids...
<P>Or vice versa.
<P>In short, thanks for your support and you're all a credit to your ... um ... ethnic groupings, or species, whatever is appropriate.

<BR>> performance of the last two months.
<P>Well, now you've used your &quot;computer crashed&quot; card. You still have your &quot;deathly ill&quot; card to play, but I'd hold off on it. There's also the &quot;stick figure week&quot;, but as this is toonbots, that's sort of a given.
<P>&gt; You're all obviously a couple dogs short of a full pack
<P>I'm personally well stocked in dogs. I'm short marbles, bricks and cards... or so they say.
<P>&gt; but you're a magnificent Jihad.
<P>Long live the JIHAD! PAFTWJ! WOOO! We're number one! WOO! Right, sorry..
<P>&gt; On second thought, I'm not sure if I'd really trust a Toonbots fan with my
<BR>> kids...
<P>Mmmmmm, kids.
<P>&gt; In short, thanks for your support and you're all a credit to your ... um
<BR>> ... ethnic groupings, or species, whatever is appropriate.
<P>Hey, just keep putting out your fine product and we won't have to hunt you down and.. er, I mean we'll keep flocking to your banner and singing your praises!

<strong>Re: Amazing</strong>
<P>&gt; You still
<BR>> have your &quot;deathly ill&quot; card to play, but I'd hold off on it.
<P>Unfortunately, I used that one in early April, shortly after the computer crashed. The ensuing stress was just too much for my delicately balanced system. And in a very real sense, the need to recode the Toon-o-Matic could be construed as the deathly illness of the artist. In a twisted, meta kind of way.
<P>I just ... ran out of excuses.
<P>And seriously, now that I can do captions again, there's no real reason not to whip out an episode whenever I get a mildly entertaining idea. It's just so faaast.
<P>&gt; There's also the &quot;stick figure week&quot;, but as this is toonbots,
<BR>> that's sort of a given.
<P>Stick figures of disembodied heads don't make much sense. And you will recall that attaining the level of being *able* to do a stick figure week was a real hurdle for me...
<P>&gt; Mmmmmm, kids.
<P>My two-year-old would snap you like a twig, Brian. He generally requires one or two trained animal tamers and a crate of duct tape. We have a Preferred Customer account with Lowe's for duct tape alone.
<P>I mean, last week, *he* ate the *Tasmanian Devil*.

<P>Despite the slur on our collective sanity, it's nice to be appreciated by the meta-cartoonist. We are magnificent, aren't we. Sniff. Meta-fictional group hug!!
<P>&gt; If it's good enough
<BR>> for Emsworth, it's good enough for you.
<P>Quite right.
<P>&gt; Of course, if you *really* wanted more Toonbots, you'd come over here and

<P>I haven't been to a movie theatre since... I think I saw &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; at the dollar theatre in November.

<strong>P. S.</strong>
<P>Oh, and while it's a bit belated (been rather hectic for me lately), that April 23 Toonbot gave me quite a shock. I was simultaneously touched and disturbed by the myriad of Mao's calling to me, attempting to worm their insidious way into my fragile sub-conscious, or whatnot.
