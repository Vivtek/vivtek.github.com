<strong>Keenvention</strong>
<P>I'm not sure if you'd seen this yet, Mr. Roberts, so I thought I'd mention. You know that Keenvention they have over in Keenspace? Well, in the new forum to discuss the matter, this thread came up (can't include a direct link, of course, but here's the URL): http://www.keenspace.com/forums/Forum196/HTML/000022.html
<P>Mr. Roustan has shown himself to be a worthy member of the PAFTWJ with this suggestion. I'm not entirely clear from the thread if they've quite decided yet. Have you received an e-mail about it? Perhaps you might add your thoughts to the thread (and perhaps make certain that the Toonbots booth is located near a window; there's a third floor spot which appears to be vacant at the moment and which I think should please the High Chancellor.) I do hope they let the jihad tag along, though.
<P>Still, this shows that Toonbots has reached a certain level of recognition by now. Matter of fact, the individual who seconded the motion is a regular on the Class Menagerie forum, so perhaps my evangelism did help; though he may have simply seconded for no good reason. He's like that sometimes (though its probably nothing that a good defenestration couldn't cure.)

<strong>Re: Keenvention</strong>
<P>Yes. We are all waiting for you at the fake, virtual convention... but not the real one. Show up there, and we'll have to beat you up.

<strong>Thanks, everybody!</strong>
<P>&gt; I'm not sure if you'd seen this yet, Mr. Roberts,
<P>I hadn't, and it made my day. That's cool!
<P>&gt; Mr. Roustan has shown himself to be a worthy member of the PAFTWJ with
<BR>> this suggestion.
<P>As have you all, and a bunch of people who are apparently reading along but not posting here. Wow. (Or they're just thirding and fourthing out of principle instead of due to their admiration for Toonbots, who knows?)
<P>I went ahead and registered. I would have earlier, except it was pretty clearly marked Keen, and as we know, I'm too cool for them. :-)

<P>Well, they could use that bit of class that we bring along with our indie selves, eh?
<P>Chris made me join, too. Well, it wasn't that he made me do it so much as he suggested it and the other person who was around when I was considering it seconded the motion. So my registration plea is in the works, complete with extra request for a booth next to a window. I hope it's a BIG window.
