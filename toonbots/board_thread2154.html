<strong>Belated Jihad Comic-Con Photos</strong>
<P>Well, although the actual events took place over a month ago now, I just recently managed to develop most of the pictures I took at the recent San Diego Comic-Con (and particularly of the Jihad's presence there.) Chris Classic was kind and creative enough to provide closed captioning for the window impaired.
<P>The following were taken from the last day of the Con, July 22, when Napoleon bussed down, and, after nearly losing each other, we attended a Hanna-Barbera cartoon screening (including Secret Squirrel and upside-down Hillbilly Bears.) She was even kind enough to bring me a small but rather significant token of esteem: <img src="http://rickbob.xidus.net/private/conmadness/bunny_ears_edited.jpg">
<P>Of course, we spent some time wandering the main floor, and spent a certain amount of time loitering around the Keenspot booth, where managed to meet one ardent fan of Napoleon's, the Keenspot poster known by many as The Black Cupid. <img src="http://rickbob.xidus.net/private/conmadness/jenny_and_TBC_edited.jpg">
<P>In addition to briefly and somewhat hesitantly hobnobbing with fans or standing in awe of the various cartoonists, Napoleon was also accorded a certain honor: <img src="http://rickbob.xidus.net/private/conmadness/spottedjenny_edited.jpg">
<P>Napoleon met a few other celebrities as well, although one seemed just a tad flighty: <img src="http://rickbob.xidus.net/private/conmadness/super_nap_edited.jpg">
<P>Finally, after saturating ourselves in screenings of odd independent or foreign cartoons (&quot;My spoon is too big!&quot;), and lingering around the main floor a bit longer, we capped off the event in the manner most becoming of representatives of the Toonbots Jihad: <img src="http://rickbob.xidus.net/private/conmadness/conwindowfun_edited.jpg">
<P>And that more or less concludes this brief, very belated, and slightly meta-fictional Comic-Con report (I have a few more pictures left, which I’ll post later, assuming I get the proper clearance from the persons depicted in them as we’d hate to risk a lawsuit, especially as I suspect Pooga’s been dipping into the PAFTWJ legal defense fund again.) However, I know that it really doesn't do justice to that day, let alone the Con as a whole. I certainly had the time of my life, and meeting Napoleon and sharing cheese and danishes with her was certainly a highlight. We missed subsidiary Jihad members such as Damonk and Paul Roustan, unfortunately. We probably should have coordinated it a bit better. Perhaps one of these years (possibly the next Con, or the one after that) we can organize a Jihad pilgrimage to San Diego, and hopefully have a few more members of the PAFTWJ hierarchy in attendance (or even the meta-cartoonist himself). I might even see about bringing balloon wolverines for such an event!

<P>I think the concept of a balloon wolverine is already sufficiently intriguing to warrant further research....

<strong>Re: Belated Jihad Comic-Con Photos</strong>
<P>&gt; I think the concept of a balloon wolverine is already sufficiently
<BR>> intriguing to warrant further research....
<P>Well, I don't know, I was speaking in terms of pencil balloon animals. It would probably be mainly a variation of the traditional balloon dog with elements of the balloon cat, perhaps, larger tail, and slightly altered dimensions. Matter of fact, been awhile since I've seriously tinkered with balloon animal art. If any of my pencil balloons aren't so old that they'll pop as I'm blowing them up, I might try to see if I can make a decent one sometime, and maybe photograph it at some point for the benefit of the Jihad. I'm thinking either purple or red (or possibly orange) would be most suitable.
<P>Oh, and as I most carelessly neglected to mention it early, many thanks also go to Napoleon who, in addition to starring in those pictures, also mnaged to successfully crop and rotate and whatnot the original scanned photographs (many of which came out rather slanted, I'm afraid.)

<strong>Wolverine Balloons!</strong>
<P>I never get to go to /anything/ fun!
<P>Great photos, Emsworth! Great editing, Napolean! I never would have guessed they weren't perfect to begin with.
<P>Wah! I wanna go to this convention thingie. The west coast is so very far away...
<P>I also want a balloon wolverine! I assume they're less fangy than the originals?

<P>&gt; Great photos, Emsworth! Great editing, Napolean! I never would have
<BR>> guessed they weren't perfect to begin with.
<P>Many thanks. Again, the editing was primarily because my scanner is not of the open bed variety, but rather a combination printer/scanner, so when inserting the photographs, the machine has a tendency to jostle them before scanning, if you follow, so the images look a tad slanted unless re-edited and whatnot.
<P>&gt; Wah! I wanna go to this convention thingie. The west coast is so very far
<BR>> away...
<P>Well, it can be a great distance (I live in Texas myself, so it was only about a 12 hour drive to San Diego). However, the San Diego Comic-Con is an annual event, so perhaps one can see about saving early for air fare or whatnot. And there are other comic conventions in the U. S. (if you're on the east coast, I believe there's an annual comics convention in Philadelphia, which might possibly be more feasible (Brad Guigar and Lee Herold were there last year, I believe.)
<P>&gt; I also want a balloon wolverine! I assume they're less fangy than the
<BR>> originals?
<P>Less fangy, yes. Fangs would have the unfortunate effect of causing the poor balloon wolverines to pop, rather messily.

<P>Mom! He's making my head hurt again! I don't follow. I got lost somewhere after 'scanner'. But don't worry about trying to explain it, I'll just get lost on the explanation of the explanation, I know from long experience.

<P>Heh. But then...see...then I'd be planning in advance. And we don't want the world to implode in a hypothetical vortex of improbability, do we now?
<P>&gt; Less fangy, yes. Fangs would have the unfortunate effect of causing the
<BR>> poor balloon wolverines to pop, rather messily.
<P>I have kind of a feeling that the original wolverines probably have the same effect on the balloon wolverines. Only more messy.

<P>We had been considering the feasibility of providing Usu with a stuffed wolverine to play with, though. Oh, and apparently BoxJam recently made it to a convention near Raleigh, North Carolina (I have nieces in NC, in fact, but they're too young to become excited about meeting a strange blue man in a muu-muu.)
