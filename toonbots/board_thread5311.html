<strong>Pftt, pfffft, testing, one, two...</strong>
<P>Yeah, I think this still works.
<P>Hey, if anybody is still here -- a new episode happened. Is it any good? It made me chuckle. That's really all I ever cared about. And you know, I feel a lot more chuckle-y nowadays. My boy is off his allergy meds, we're all tan and much more relaxed, and I kid you not, as soon as we actually decided to leave Bloomington, the paying work started to come in a deluge. I've translated more than 100,000 words in August. That's going to pay a lot of bills. It's the best month I've had since late 2001.
<P>Not only that. I finished a project (well, it's still not completely finished, but they're down to checking database entries now; the programming is done) and nearly finished another. I got a new paying *technical* customer for the first time in two years, one with an actual budget, actual specs, and an actual timeline for development. Like in the old days. The guy read my resume and convinced himself he needed me. Like in the old days.
<P>All in all, a lot of things are starting to feel like the Good Old Days. I'm actually getting up in the morning and working, instead of getting up and reading politics until I can't stand it any more. My wife isn't staying up nights crying. My son isn't getting ear infections. My daughter is back homeschooling and is really starting to open up and become a member of the family again -- and she's also roaring through the algebra problems I'm setting up for her (did I mention she's 10?)
<P>And we actually have friends of ours in our house in Bloomington, not just paying (somewhat low) rent but he's a home-improvement addict. I pay materials, he fixes things. They'll be in Bloomington another three years. That's a lot of fixed things. There's nothing nicer than having tenants you know aren't going to break things -- but to know they'll be unbreaking things is sheerly impossible. Except this time.
<P>I could get used to things working out for a change.
<P>Anyway, I hope you like this episode. Given that it's the first in nine months, it couldn't be worse, right?

<P>yay! michael lives! mao lives! the toon-o-matic lives! hurrah!
<P>i bet you didn't think about things like dear frances when you chose san juan, did you? hah! there is retribution for this indolent lifestyle of sitting around on sunny beachs drinking fru-fru rum drinks! you strive to escape mold and snow and other ills of mankind - but man is born to sorrow as the sparks fly upward, and ye who wouldst flee the demons of ice must yet face the wrath of the wind and waves, whilst we who toil, office-bound and sober, are spared*! nyaa nya nya nya nya-nyaaa!
<P>seriously, glad the world is going well for you and yours...but i hope all the work will still leave you a little time for 'tooning.
<P>*well, ok, there _was_ that two-hour meeting i started the day with...but the volume of hot air didn't _quite_ reach hurricane force.
<P>

<strong>Re: hellohellohello!</strong>
<P>&gt; yay! michael lives! mao lives! the toon-o-matic lives! hurrah!
<P>Huzzah, huzzah!
<P>&gt; i bet you didn't think about things like dear frances when you chose san
<BR>> juan, did you?
<P>Yes, actually, I did. I'm kind of looking forward to seeing the edge of a hurricane tomorrow.
<P>&gt; there is retribution for this indolent lifestyle of
<BR>> sitting around on sunny beachs drinking fru-fru rum drinks!
<P>Ugh, I loathe rum.
<P>&gt; you strive to
<BR>> escape mold and snow
<P>Wait. You live in Southern California.
<P>&gt; and other ills of mankind - but man is born to sorrow
<BR>> as the sparks fly upward, and ye who wouldst flee the demons of ice must
<BR>> yet face the wrath of the wind and waves, whilst we who toil, office-bound
<BR>> and sober, are spared*! nyaa nya nya nya nya-nyaaa!
<P>Oh, good form. Our judges are saying 9.8, 9.7, 9.9, and 7.6 from the Russian.
<P>&gt; seriously, glad the world is going well for you and yours...but i hope all
<BR>> the work will still leave you a little time for 'tooning.
<P>It's not the time, it's the impetus. Either the toon writes itself, or it doesn't. Yesterday, it just ... did. For the first time in a year. That's the way it's supposed to be.
<P>Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to the pool now.

<strong>Re: hellohellohello!</strong>
<P>&gt; Wait. You live in Southern California.
<P>yeah - but _we_ don't drink fru-fru rum drinks while watching the sunset on the beach. we drink white wine. and we have to transfer it to a non-glass container. nothing but hardship and hard work, here.

<P>&gt; yeah - but _we_ don't drink fru-fru rum drinks while watching the sunset
<BR>> on the beach. we drink white wine. and we have to transfer it to a
<BR>> non-glass container. nothing but hardship and hard work, here.
<P>Yeah, Californians do things like follow rules. Puerto Rico has the same laws, but I haven't noticed anybody not taking glass containers onto the beach yet.
<P>The most charming thing here is how they drive. Like maniacs. Kind of like ... *relaxed* maniacs. I always considered New Castle, Indiana, to be representative of bad driving, but man, after Ponce, I've got newfound respect for New Castle. These people make two lanes when they think they can fit, they pass on the right, the left, the shoulder, the sidewalk (I swear this actually happened), they run red lights with wild abandon, basically they just point the car where they want to go and try not to hit very much on the way. It's hilarious. Because nobody gets mad or honks, they just all drive like equal maniacs, and they kind of laugh while they're doing it.
<P>People laugh more here. And whistle, and sing. I mean, Bloomington is a really, really nice place to live, and beats Ponce in many ways, but we truly needed this down here.
<P>But here's one weird thing: population 100,000, number of public libraries: 0. Number of bookstores (except textbook stores at colleges): 0. Really -- zero. No bookstores. Fortunately there are two Borders stores in San Juan. Last week we went up there and spent $120 to get us through a few weeks. And in December, they tell me there's a Borders opening in Mayaguez, which is closer to Ponce. So there's hope.

<strong>Two in a Row!</strong>
<P>Gad, I can't imagine being in an area with absolutely no libraries or bookstores. I would pine away, physically and intellectually.
<P>And heavens, Michael! One strip's not enough, you had to update *the very next day* two! Wow! With lengthy blurbs again, even! (The last few felt unusually unsubstantial to me).
<P>And from our former high priest, gopher, re Frances and the blurbs/updates: &quot;hm. it is on track to hit san juan, and the national hurricane center is saying that georgia and florida might get a bit... jeez, that post sounds like something I'd come up with in making-fun-of-WREK mode.&quot;
<P>And mouse, I still hope to get your goodie (and yes, a Con update) to you soon. Relatively. I'm considering following Michael's footsteps in such things.

<P>It lost a lot without the context. Or something. And just to be able to make fun of them, I turned on WREK to see what they're playing right now. It's a track called &quot;Breath&quot;, and appears to be a recording of someone breathing, sometimes humming without any direction in particular, and occasionally hitting a xylophone.

<P>i would end up spending my entire substance on amazon.com, and having to provide the postman with a new back brace every christmas. this _does_ put the whole tropical paradise thing in perspective.

<P>*sigh* well, i guess since we met here at toonbots, i should have expected michael would become someone's role model. still, it was sweet of you to get me _anything_, since i left you on your own (so to speak), so i will wait with patience!
