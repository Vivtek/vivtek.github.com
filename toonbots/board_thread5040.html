<strong>Propaganda Thesis Availability</strong>
<P>Though I e-mailed Michael a zip file of the finished thesis, all 150 plus pages with images, if anyone else in the Jihad is interested in reading the thing, &quot;Narrative and Imagery in US Animated Films with Elements of Propaganda from WWII (or Donald Duck vs. Hitler),&quot; feel free to download.
<P>www.harrymccracken.com/thesis/PropagandaThesis.zip
<P>My friend Harry McCracken, who also fact-checked an early version of the paper, is kindly hosting it on his space. Be aware that the zip file is 9MB, and the actual word doc is 13.8MB.
<P>Would like to know what everyone or anyone thinks.
<P>If nothing else, gaze and marvel at the images, including Goofy strangling Hitler at swordpoint.

<P>ok - after that, you _know_ i gotta at least look at the pictures. i'm downloading it now (over my nice slow modem connection) - and will look it over with interest.

<P>&gt; That's terrific, Ems!
<P>&gt; Congratulations on being all done!
<P>Many thanks. This Saturday, I walk down in triumph. A week from then, my beloved elder female sibling and her three little ones, the youngest of whom I haven't seen and the middle of which has made me her imaginary friend/scapegoat, shall be joining us for the holiday festivities. Preparations therefore are hectic, of course, but be a pleasure to see them and watch little kids tearing through wrapping paper again.

<P>yay jenn!
<P>i did download the thesis, but i'll be reading it on-screen (it's a little long for my printer) - so it may be a while before i get back to you. and enjoy your triumphant walk!
<P>&gt; the middle of which has made me her imaginary
<BR>> friend/scapegoat
<P>_that_ sounds like an interesting relationship...you may have to provide us with additional stories (like, how did she turn you into an imaginary being? you looked perfectly real at comic-con.)
<P>&gt; ... watch little kids tearing through wrapping paper again.
<P>kids are the best reason for holidays. plus, they're the only ones it's really fun to shop for.
<P>i don't suppose one of them is an 8 year old girl? while i'm more than happy to just do general kid shopping, it would help this year to have specific ideas of what that sex/age class is into this year....

<strong>Re: Jenn Lives! Yay!</strong>
<P>&gt; yay jenn!
<P>Seconded! How goes it with you, Jenn? Decorated for the holidays yet? This year, now that I have a scanner, I hope to take some snaps of my Coca-Cola village, land of enchantment, snow, and caffeine.
<P>&gt; i did download the thesis, but i'll be reading it on-screen (it's a little
<BR>> long for my printer) - so it may be a while before i get back to you. and
<BR>> enjoy your triumphant walk!
<P>That's fine, but have you seen Goofy yet? Or Donald throwing the tomatoe at Hitler or wearing Nazi garb? Or Elmer Fudd as a doughboy and Porky Pig as a sailor dancing behind Bugs? If you don't have time to finish reading, just skim through the strange and fascinating images! And agreed on length. Imagine having to print six copies, however. In the end I gave up and had to go to Kinko's, and only found out *afterwards* that there's a UTEP student rate.
<P>&gt; _that_ sounds like an interesting relationship...you may have to provide
<BR>> us with additional stories (like, how did she turn you into an imaginary
<BR>> being? you looked perfectly real at comic-con.)
<P>&quot;I was outside taking a car ride with Uncle Andrew.&quot; &quot;No, Uncle Andrew can't be on the phone waiting to talk to me, he's in class!&quot; &quot;I didn't do it, Uncle Andrew broke it!&quot;
<P>And I'd only met her when she was an infant. Touchingly odd, I'd so.
<P>&gt; i don't suppose one of them is an 8 year old girl? while i'm more than
<BR>> happy to just do general kid shopping, it would help this year to have
<BR>> specific ideas of what that sex/age class is into this year....
<P>Actually, if memory serves, the eldest is turning nine or so, so close enough. Youngest, Aliyah Mahoganey, will be three; middle one, Nadia Unique, the one who drinks tea with my meta-fictional doppleganger, is six, I think. The eldest, Tyisha, adored &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; more than expected. And she likes to draw. Sis thinks she must have caught some of my genes by osmosis during her brief visits.

<strong>Christmas Fun</strong>
<P>&gt; How goes it with you, Jenn? Decorated for the holidays yet?
<P>We don't decorate in our NYC apt! We...okay. Yeah. I made a Christmas angel that is currently adorning our television. I think it makes a statement. Of some sort.
<P>I /did/ go up and down 5th Avenue with a friend of mine in her annual 'Christmas Orgy + Tea' tradition. I discovered that I can purchase an oversized, bright pink, NotEvenSureHowToDescribeIt, fur tuke. I think everyone on my Christmas list needs one.
<P>There was a woman trying on leopard skin berets. The salesgirl was vainly telling her she looked great, and appealed to her boyfriend to confirm this. Strangely enough, I was not asked for my opinion. She looked like an idiot.
<P>It was a very nice day.

<P>Pardon? What do you mean, my dear mouse? Check your browser. It should so a picture of Gwendolyn preparing for the holidays. Partially colored in paint. It shows up for me, and showed up for a friend in Israel, so try refreshing.

<P>ok...it's clearly some campaign by netscape to get me to upgrade, by refusing to let me see anything anymore. it works in explorer.
<P>you know, she kind of reminds me of one of my mom's cats - after said cat &quot;helped&quot; decorate the tree....

<P>but you must! what exactly is a 'tuke'? (my dictionary goes straight from 'tuition' to 'tularemia' without even glancing at any 'tuk's. i do love dictionaries.)
<P>&gt; It was a very nice day. any day you can laugh at someone in a leopardskin beret is a good day, in my book...

<P>A tuke is a knit shapeless hat, what (growing up) I called a &quot;toboggan&quot; for some reason. In Hungarian it's a &quot;sapi&quot; or &quot;sapka&quot;. The word &quot;tuke&quot; is vaguely Canadian in origin, although I've heard it used (as a non-joke) by a person from Northern Ohio.

<P>This one had ear flaps. I've heard it called 'toboggan' before. And it was oversized. One would have looked vaguely like an anime character with it on. No one was trying it on, though. I can't imagine why.

<P>ah...perhaps this is similar to the 'toque' i seem to recall mentioned in 'framed', i think?

<P>I've only seen it spelled toque, and sometimes touque.
