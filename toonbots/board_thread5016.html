<strong>Belated Birthday Greeting</strong>
<P>to our own Brother Emsworth. Whose exact birthday I still forget, even after asking him a couple of weeks ago. I'm lucky to remember my children's. (Seriously: I'm always a little fuzzy on my son's because he was premature.)

<P>well, you're ahead of me - happy birthday, emsworth!
<P>(i mean about emsworth, of course. the thought of your son's birthday never even entered my mind. i mean, of course i could figure out that he _has_ one, but when it might be, and the impact on memories thereof (although one would think a premature birth would sort of sear the date into your head - although i guess that would depend _how_ premature...slightly premature might actually make the whole birthing thing simpler (not that i have actual experience with this)) (and actually, although i was similarly aware that emsworth had a birthday, i really didn't know when it was - but then i really am bad at such things -
<P>ok, clearly i'm raving, and also running out of parentheses.
<P>Happy (Belated) Birthday, Emsworth! (and have some parentheses (on me)))))(()()

<P>Four weeks, and it would have been simpler, if the whole family hadn't had a fever of like 101. But I was expecting an April birth, you see, and it being March 4 instead (with the 4 for April) just continues to screw me up, even now.

<P>Eww. There are parentheses on you.

<P>They tend to favor dirty jokes, especially ones involving cosecants.
