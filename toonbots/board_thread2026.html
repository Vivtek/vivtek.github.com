<strong>New comics?</strong>
<P>Hey, guys?
<P>That time has come...I've read all the archives for everything that my friends suggested in January when I said 'I need something to do at work.'
<P>So does anyone have any comics that they read that they like that I should be reading? Of course I'm reading Snail Dust, Faraway Stars and Rick and Bob. Am I missing any other Jihad member's comic? Cause I have this belief that everyone on this forum is a cartoonist, with the exception of me. Emsworth probably has one, I just missed it. The whole concept makes me sing 'Which one of these things is not like the others?' while pointing at myself. Needless to say, it's disturbing for my coworkers. So help everyone out and suggest something new (and possibly with a /massive/ archive?) for me to do instead?
<P>Just to get this out of the way...I do read Boxjam (though I haven't been able to get there the last couple of days) and Chopping Block. I think I remember they posted here once, long ago. Before they got too famous for the likes of the Jihad, probably. *sniff* Swimming in adulation...swimming pools full of champagne (or maybe blood in the case of Butch) and truffles and stuff....
<P>(Don't hurt me!)
<P>Huh. I read 46 comics. I guess I could list them out so you'd know what I'm already reading...Absurd Notions, Acid Reflux, Alice, Avalon, BoxJam, Burnt Dog Radio, Clan of the Cats, Chopping Block, Cigarro &amp; Cerjeva, CRFH, Diabolica (at least until that story line finishes! Wah!) Diesel Sweeties, Elf Life, Exploitation Now, Faraway Stars, Framed, Funny Farm, General Protection Fault, Goats, Greystone Inn, Grimbles, Iron Shamrock, Irritability, Jeremy, Kevin and Kell, MegaTokyo, Necronomicron, No Stereotypes, One Clown Short, Ozzy &amp; Millie, Penny Arcade, Pokey the Penguin, Purple Duck Mambo, PvP, Rick &amp; Bob, Schlock Mercenary, Sluggy, Snail Dust, Soap on a Rope, Todd &amp; Penguin, Toonbots (well, duh...), Ubersoft, User Friendly, Vicious Lies, Warp 9 to Hell, Weird Theorum.
<P>Thanks, guys! It's a lot more personal than just going to Keenspot and pointing randomly! Besides, as we all know, there's a whole lot of comics FAR too cool for Keenspot. Ahem.

<P>Wow. There are couple on there I've never heard of. But you'd like Checkerboard Nightmare (http://www.nightlightpress.com), Polymer City Chronicles (http://www.polymer-city.com) and RPG World (http://www.rpgworld.com).
<P>Lee Herold and BoxJam drop by occasionally. They are, of course, Cool Enough.

<strong>Re: New comics?</strong>
<P>&gt;Am I missing any other Jihad member's comic? Cause I have this belief that &gt;everyone on this forum is a cartoonist, with the exception of me. Emsworth &gt;probably has one, I just missed it.
<P>To clear up any possible confusion, I do not have a webcomic as of the present time, no. Of the titled Jihad hierarchy, neither do gopher or Pooga. However, Tim Bram, our currently absent Knight Artificer of Pixels, does have one, &quot;LFC&quot; (http://members.home.net/timberbram/lfc/index.html).
<P>However, here are a few comics that come to my mind, which have not yet been mentioned, which you might find interesting or amusing:
<P>Narbonic (http://www.narbonic.com/): Still haven't quite finished the archives, but the flowing drawing style is interesting, and the central character, mad scientist Helen Narobn, very amusing, and the strip itself almost certainly worth at least a look.
<P>Odd Jobs (http://oddjobs.keenspace.com): Simply but effectively rendered in a fairly realistic style, this well plotted strip, despite evident roots in hard-boiled detective fiction and film noire, actually reminds me most of such radio series as &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar.&quot; I'd suggest starting, if not from the beginning, then from the beginning of the current storyline. It updates twice a week.
<P>Toy Trunk Railroad (http://www.toytrunkrailroad.com/): Probably most likely to interest you if you had even as much as a mild fascination for trains (real ones or models) in you’re your youth, but still fairly amusing, and even rather meta, in it's way.
<P>There's more I could name (Blotto Street, Gene Catlow, Class Menagerie, the defunct Absolute Tripe which still has hilarious archives, other strips reviewed by Michael on this site), and I might add more later, if desired, but that's probably enough for the moment. I have difficulty enough keeping up with 12-20 webcomics at a time, myself.
