<strong>Toonbots NYC Munch?</strong>
<P>Hey y'all! Any Toonbotians in the NYC area and want to do like a...munch type thing? If that's okay with Michael? Lemme know! I promise to not disappear again for at least a week. :)

<P>Check the old posts, mouse. Unless Michael has extended his visit without notice, he should be returning around Sep. 21. Of course, the interim between his return and the resumption of the strip or his e-mail response is, as always, indeterminate.
<P>Only other Jihad member who is in New York state, let alone near NYC, would be Eric Schissel from Ithaca. I may drop him a line, see if he's tentatively interested until the date is fully confirmed.

<P>you expect me to remember something i read more than a day or so ago? your faith in my memory, although sadly misplaced, touches me nonetheless.
<P>and besides - remember all the teasing about coming wolverine attractions? i wouldn't put it past him to dangle his return before us, only to take a sudden side trip to iceland.

<P>Good point, but in as much as he had asked Jenn if she could meet him when he arrived and presumably had already booked his return passage, I assume a sidetrip to Iceland would only be the result of his vessel being hijacked by buccaneer penguins. Actually, considering the 19th is National Talk Like a Pirate Day and the announced return of Opus, it might not be that improbable.

<P>Arrr!
<P>(Just practicing)
<P>Eric can't make it, so I guess I'll just have to do an article on the event for The People's Glorious Toonbot Web Magazine. Look forward to it!
