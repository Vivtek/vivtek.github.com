<P>Ever since I found that tag, I've had a TMBG song going through my head. Come to think of it, that's not so unusual, since I often have a TMBG song going through my head. :)
<P>I just finished reading all the messages I've missed in my extended absense. Well, all the ones that haven't been archived, anyway. I hate it. There were dozens of topics I was going to reply to, then I realized that almost all of them were about two months old. Oh, well.
<P>Don't know what else to say. Krob. (I'm feeling contrary today)

<P>Since no one else has done so here, welcome back, o Pooglian one! Nice to have you back on the jihad roster! You've missed quite a bit (such as accusations of cannibalism.)
<P>Oh, and as I mentioned in one of the now archived threads, I remember your mentioning an interest in Skip Hinnant, the voice of Fritz the Cat (who also played Pogo Possum in the obscure 8o's film &quot;Pogo for President, and was heard in guest bits on &quot;My Little Pony.&quot;) I found a website, www.voicebank.net, which contains the house reels for many talent agencies for voice actors, with individual short demo bits available as mp3's. Here's the address for Skip Hinnant's demo (which includes a portrayal of a toilet.)

<strong>Cannibalism?!</strong>

<P>Dear Sir, as a Jihad officer I abhor the implication that the PAFTWJ is a haven for cannibalism. It is well known that we now have the problem relatively under control, and that it is the Sluggites who now suffer the largest casualties in this area. And what do you think the Ufies ate at Comicon? Dust Puppies? Yours etc. Grand Vizier Pooga Poogissima in a white wine sauce with shallots, mushrooms and garlic.

<P>I think I saw that one before I had to drop out entirely. I'm sorry if I didn't reply to that effect. I do remember listening to some of his sound clips, although the only one that sticks out in my mind at the moment is one for &quot;Love My Carpet.&quot; :) It's also nice to know that SOMEONE noticed my absence.

<P>Dear Sir,
<P>I must take the strongest possible exception to the letters on this message board. They are clearly not written by the general public and are merely included for a cheap laugh.
