<strong>Have i mentioned you're a god lately?</strong>
<P>...um, because you are. Otherwise Iwould have called you something else.
<P>Like a risotto.
<P>Switching the truck was wonderful, and i loved you the MORE for it, man! I won't pretend that i knew what the truck said, but only assumed it was something clever in Russian, which our good ole' friend BJ confirmed with his typical erudite efficiency.
<P>To me, it was ALL good, sir.
<P>As always.
<P>But why do we only get MORE now, and not MORE WOLVERINES?

<strong>No.</strong>
<P>
<BR>> But why do we only get MORE now, and not MORE WOLVERINES?
<P>Two reasons. First, MORE WOLVERINES loses its appeal in Emsworth's absence. Second and of course much more sublimely, NEXT: MORE is the natural templatization of NEXT: MORE WOLVERINES -- I could have written NEXT: MORE [[INSERT PLURAL NOUN]] but I thought (incorrectly, as it turned out) that you'd get it anyway.
<P>Sigh. Nothing frustrates the true artist more than a lack of subtle discernment in his public. But I'm glad we had the chance to talk about this. It was good of you to bring it up.

<strong>Re: No.</strong>
<P>I suppose I've been sitting in front of too many nix boxes; I see next: more and I think it's time to hit any key to continue.

<strong>More! More! More!</strong>
<P>More wombats! I'm not sure what I think about this.
<P>It could be a good thing. It could be a sign of the toon expanding and testing new horizons of...umm...animal kingdomness.
<P>Or Michael could have been paid off by the National Council for Wombat Optimization.
<P>Either way, I'm frightened of change. Bring back the wolverines!

<P>&quot;Wombat of the mines&quot; was a phrase from that Toonbot-Babelfish episode I did a while ago. I thought it would be an amusing catchphrase.

<BR>> episode I did a while ago. I thought it would be an amusing catchphrase.
<P>it does have a certain appeal (especially given that history - which episode was that?)
<P>from the stand point of natural history-ness, though, i think wombats and wolverines (altho alliterative) are not a good combination. (altho if the wombats stick to the mines, they might have a chance)

<P>I took &quot;Next: More&quot; to be a joke in and of itself (and I laughed at it), since it's redundant and cliche'. If there's anything to be NEXT it'd have to be MORE, unless it's a blank strip, which might still be argued is &quot;more&quot; than there was.
<P>Next: Something Else!

<strong>The forum monster won't let me leave this blank.</strong>
<P>Oooooh. Minimalist humor. Minimalist humor featuring the Tirdun guy. I like.
<P>Even though I sat there for about 5 minutes, waiting patiently for our very slow network to load the rest of the comic. Thinking, &quot;Geez, we're slow today.&quot; Before I figured out what was going on. This of course makes it even more funny.

<P>Of course, given my tendency to head direct for forum, I missed the whole thing, and had to skritch my horsy head, look at today's toon,
<P>and... well... hit back for more.
<P>Sigh.
