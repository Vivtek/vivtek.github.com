<strong>100 Toonboots!</strong>
<P>Yay! I get to be the first to post on the anniversary!
<P>Happy anniversary, Michael! Happy anniversary, Toonbot! Happy anniversary, Dot! Happy anniversary, Bot! Happy anniversary, Dead Communists! Happy anniversary, ummm...stick figures who's names escape me for the moment! Happy anniversary, wolverines! Happy anniversary, everybody!
<P>We should have a party! Michael has been hinting that a pilgrimage to his house would be rewarded with party favors. (or maybe I was totally making that up. I can't remember. I am the Teflon Jihad Member.) Party at Michael's! I'll bring the pony!

<strong>Re: 100 Toonboots!</strong>
<P>&gt; Yay! I get to be the first to post on the anniversary!
<P>um - i hate to start out by being a petty niggling spoilsport -- but technically the _anniversary_ (defined as: the annually recurring DATE of a past event from: annus, year; + versus, past participle of vertere, to turn; my emphasis) is the 21st; this is more a _milestone_ (defined as: an important event, as in a person's career, the history of a nation, or the advancement of knowledge in a field; a turning point.) (also: A stone marker set up on a roadside to indicate the distance in miles from a given point.)
<P>by any definition, i think this is a milestone well worth celebrating; a wildly important event to those of us priviledged to be of the PAFTWJ, for michael, and indeed for the nation as a whole (little though it may know it), for the insight it has given us into the heretofore little-known interactions between al and dubya, will and the commies, and osama and the wolverines; clearly an advancement of knowledge (indeed, the wellspring of all knowledge) in the field of metacartooning; a turning point in all our lives (sucking us, as it has, into this whirlpool of toonboticity) (and, yes, occasionally something to trip over in the road). i am heady with the delight of this whirlwind tour through the high points of metacartooning as we know it, and delirious with expectation of the coming adventures, as toonbots soars to new heights of greatness, with the promises of drawing, wolverines, and a forum that remembers our names. (also slightly dizzy, what with the whirling and soaring)
<P>and charmed as every by this toon-of-toons, already a classic. i swoon at the simple yet subtle poetry of the script, from the compelling alliteration of: &quot;
<P>&quot;
<P>through the stirring excitement of:
<P>and the final, soulful, antipentultimate exhortion: SADFL kjoiwu eroi usdpoi fuwe r87x
<P>indeed, words for us all to take to heart, in these troubled times.
<P>(and a damned fine blurb, too.)
<P>congratulations, michael! and actually it is a good milestone - interesting and indeed impressive to see how far you have come in only 100 'toons

<P>&gt; mouse, this blurb is hilarious! I'm obviously out of my league here.
<P>yours humbly is grateful for such kind praise from the master. i mean -- &quot;....fuwe r87x&quot; -- such genius, i practically choke up every time i think of it.
<P>truly, i think in reading your work, one can only quote the words of the great one himself:
<P>&quot;hey fred&quot;
<P>really, what more can one say?
<P>[except that it was actually funnier with the quotes in it - is there any way to keep everything between &gt; and &lt; from disappearing?]

<P>No.
<P>This gives me an opportunity to laugh at my fans, of course. (Just ask Emsworth.)
<P>Sigh. I do wish I had more time.

<P>Pressured, but belated anniversary congratulations, Michael, just so you won't have an excuse to yell at me in a surly manner later.
