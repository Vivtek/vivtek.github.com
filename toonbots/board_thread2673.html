<strong>Training Day</strong>
<P>Good flick! Just when it ended and I thought, wow, not bad -- there was another half hour of much more involved plot.
<P>That's the way I like it.
<P>Also -- the TRAILER FOR THE LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!! WOW!!!! Having just read the book, I actually recognized, on sight, nearly every scene in the trailer. Besides, Patrick Stewart as Gandalf the Grey..... OH yeah. December 19th. I'm there.

<strong>Lord of the Training Rings</strong>
<P>Course I haven't seen Training Day. I never see anything. But I'm planning on Dec 19th. And I was toying with the idea of reading the book so that I could come out of it and send out a post declaring this, that, or the other thing. Then again, if I don't read the book, odds are really good that I'll enjoy the movie a heck of a lot more. Unless they do a good job on the movie, in which case I will enjoy the movie even more than if I hadn't read the book.
<P>Why do you care? Um. I dunno.
<P>

<P>I would recommend you read the book first. For one, they're damned good books. And for two -- from the trailer they have really made the books into the movies. I mean, looking *at the trailer* I recognized nearly every little snippet, it was that close. And the bits were about 0.25 seconds long, leaving me very little time to search my memory; these were flash recognition.
<P>So I recommend reading the book first.
<P>&gt; Why do you care? Um. I dunno.
<P>Because we like you.

<strong>Re: Lord of the Training Rings</strong>
<P>the books are _definitely_ worth reading. (and start with _the hobbit_, of course)
<P>i haven't spotted the trailer yet, but i keep hearing raves, so may have to look for it. i personally retain suspicions because the books are so looong - they can't possibly have fit all of that into a movie. but the fact that they apparently haven't made anything up is a plus.
<P>......and patrick stewart (yum!)

<P>I'm sure it's compressed -- but remember that this will be a movie trilogy. So this movie is just _The Fellowship of the Ring_.
<P>They have made at least one change, though. I don't know how recently you read the book, but when the party ventures into Moria, the first night they stay in a watchroom and Merry playfully throws a stone into the well to see how deep it is. Only the next day do they reach the tomb of Balin, where they (1) find a bunch of defenders, dead, and (2) get attacked by orcs.
<P>In the trailer, Moria is full of dead dwarves, and Merry inadvertently knocks a *skull* into the well, followed by the rest of the skeleton. So the cause-and-effect of Merry's action is made much more overt -- they know they're in immediate danger, and an entire armored corpse falls with much banging and clanging to alert the orcs of their presence.
<P>However, the scene is still pretty much the same, you see, just made more blatant so that it can still be understood in movie form.
<P>The Black Riders look pretty darned menacing. The two gigantic statues of the High Kings flanking the river Anduin look pretty darned great. The elves look like elves, the dwarves look like dwarves, the hobbits look like hobbits, and Gandalf is wearing grey (and a big floppy pointed hat), *just like the book says*. Compare that to the atrocious liberties taken with Dune, and I think it all points to a pretty serious attempt to be faithful to the book and I CAN'T WAIT!

<strong>Re: Lord of the Training Rings</strong>
<P>Well, I could go both ways here. I could agree with Michael about the trailer's compliance with the book and optomistically look forward to the movie as a result. That would probably be mentally healthy and all.
<P>Or...I could decide that if you have a movie full of inaccuracies that has 20 seconds of stuff that was exactly as the book says, you sure as heck are going to show those sections so that you don't have a bunch of geeks on the internet defaming your work before it even opens.
<P>Or maybe you don't care cause you're a big movie executive and the vast majority of the nation doesn't read, period, let alone having read Tolken.
<P>&gt; Compare that to the atrocious liberties taken with Dune
<P>He's trying to make this string really long, just like the last time we talked about Dune. You see that? He's sneaky! (I'll just recap the important parts of that conversation for me right now to save time: Dune = A young Sting barechested = A real good thing.)
<P>This is a side note, but did you notice Boxjam had Michael dragged off by a giant spider yesterday? I think retaliation, possibly involving wolverines, if Emsworth can spare them, is in order!

<P>Oh, hell. You had to go and spoil my anticipation. I'm still looking forward to it. So there.

<P>Fine, fine -- the rest of it sucked, though (except for the shield effect.)

<P>Dangit! I was /this/ close to the first step in my plot to take over the world being complete!
<P>Hrm.
<P>I guess I'll have to think of another way to demoralize Michael.
<P>Hey, Michael? I heard the government is thinking of outlawing Hungarian Apes. Seems that they are suspected of carrying biological weapons and confusing Customs Officers with their jibber jabber.
