<strong>Nathan Diehl, recidivist moron</strong> <i>Thu Nov 29 02:26:36 2001</i><br>
<strong>Reed this if you need extra cash to pay for that spelling class</strong>
<P>Hi!  My name is Nathan Diehl and I'm a morally bankrupt, marginally literate
user of AOL who calls his uncle "Pappy."  I live in a <i>double</i>-wide
trailer at 9802 Rambling Trail, Houston, TX 77089, with my wife, "Sis," our four wolf-hounds, and a pig.
Now, thanks to the wonders of Internet technology, you can be as prosperous as
I am!  Just send me money, and it'll all work out.  If you can't trust an
anonymous illiterate online, who <i>can</i> you trust?
<p>
<font size=-1>Note from the metacartoonist <i> and owner of this site:</i> I took the liberty of editing Nathan's post for length.
  Nathan, if you actually come back here -- please complain.  It will make it ever
so much more satisfying to laugh at you.<p>
Diagnosis: standard 6-place MMF scam/spam, Fools as follows for posterity:
<ol>
<li>Jacob Lineberry 341 Brookfield Circle Sanford, NC 27330
<li>Kesha Jackson 28 Beacon St. Apt #1 Fitchburg, MA 01420
<li>Angella Orr 60 North Bryant Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15202
<li>Judith Soha 23763 SE Summerhill Lane Issaquah, WA 98029
<li>JP Castillo 1525 East 29th Street Apt#207 Bryan, TX 77802
<li>Nathan Diehl 9802 Rambling trail Houston, TX 77089
</ol>
And for what it's worth, if any sane or literate individual was in doubt,
this is <i>not</i> legal, nor will it make anybody at all even close to
rich.

<strong>Re: Reed this if you need extra cash</strong>
<P>Apparently, the origin of the internet term &quot;SPAM&quot; is &quot;Single Person Addressed Multiply&quot; or something thelike. We don't yet have evidence to the effect that strictly applies here, though I shouldn't be surprised if it did.
<P>Anyhow, it was only a matter of time before this (google-archived, etc!) board picked up some... (unless it's been picking up a deal all along and the good Moderator has simply been performing his duties in hiding it from view. Goodness knows my mailbox is full of it, in both senses I can think of of that ambiguous phrase. How much spam must an email account holder receive in a day? The answer, my friend, is blowing on the wind.)
<P>(Says I, a great respecter of the mores and traditions of the 60s movements but not averse to making the occasional joke tant meme. I had nothing to do with that spam, if anyone needs to know, and no objection to this post's being removed along with it of course if need be...)

<P>Meet Jessica and Heather, two HOT sorority Co-Eds, dripping with baby oil and all hot and bothered to refinance your morgage. Turn all your credit cards into one low, HOT monthly payment. See their sweaty naked buisness degrees and worship their loan depreciation skills. Its alright with them if you've been naughty on your tax returns, they LIKE it.
<P>And for the ladies, we have tight, muscle bound hunks with graphical calculators at the READY. They'll make you feel like a WOMAN as they get you a LOW LOW HOT interest rate. That's right. All billed discretely to you. No fantasy rates are too low, dirty talk encouraged.

<strong>Demographical Spam</strong>
<P>&gt; And for the ladies, we have tight, muscle bound hunks with graphical
<BR>> calculators at the READY.
<P>It's nice that we're being thought of. I feel very included as a woman.
<P>However, what I really need is a HUNGARIAN APE to get my credit report FREE FREE FREE for me.
<P>More importantly, what's a troll? Enlighten the forum chaste? (I only go on Michael's forum. It's the only forum for me. Watch me caress my steamy keyboard at www.JihadBabes.com for only $5.99 a minute!)
<P>And people really go on forums and post this stuff? That's so...wrong. I mean, mindless drivel spewing from my mouth should be read and appreciated. But this...I feel violated in the sanctum of the Jihad forum.
<P>Uh-oh. I just got an idea that seems really funny on three hours of sleep. Which probably means it's offensive. I apologize in advance. But think of the marketing potential here!
<P>Napolean clad in a neglige and fuzzy slippers, defenestrating a hapless citizen. mouse leaning seductively over her 30,000th post, pencil tip dangling from her mouth in spite of the fact that she doesn't use or need pencils to post. Jenn babbling incessantly stark raving nekked (except maybe a rainbow wig? I dunno what I think about that). Wait. Maybe Jenn with duct tape over her still incessantly babbling mouth for those kinky visitors.
<P>We could make millions. We could do a calendar. We could put an olympic size swimming pool in the Jihad headquarters.
<P>God, I'm tired.

<P>I rather doubt it myself, but assuming this is the first, I hope we won't see too much more of it. I always thought that was one advantage to the Toonbots forum, being able to avoid spammers and trolls and whatnot. Ah, well. At first I thought it might have been a joke or something, but it now seems to me that this was perpetrated by an infidel, who as such should be defenestrated post-hatse, as soon as Napoleon has time. Still, couldn't the fellow at least have spelled &quot;read&quot; correctly? As for the rest, well... multiple exclamation marks are a sure sign of a diseased mind.

<P>You're probably right.
<P>My general philosophy in practice and principle has/have diverged- in practice I delete and ignore the verdammt things (pardon mismatch please); in principle I'm entirely with such people as Mr. Brown (of the &quot;Superguy List&quot;) with his TDSM spam-attack program (against email spam), Matthew &quot;Ducky&quot; Tepper (often seen on the newsgroup rec.music.classical (and also rec.music.classical.recordings where I post more than occasionally myself)), an ex-spammer (currently works in a rather more valuable field, I'm given to understand) with *no* tolerance for the stuff and a tendency to post immediate response to each Spam post and an immediate letter to the abuse dept. of each Spammer's ISP, repeat as necessary (it's made those newsgroups - hardly spamfree, but certainly less spammy than average, I will say that) ...
<P>Sigh.
<P>Not the only such place (I think of my attitude towards foods) where my heart and my brain and my actions don't agree, hrm.

<P>Probably should have occurred to me, when choosing my userid, that I -am- listed. Bother.

Otherwise I would have gone either with one of my old aliases (the sort I used to MUD with) or chosen a new one...
<P>Of course, people are rightly more security-conscious these days! (Though I've always thought myself to have a hint of simple paranoia to me interlacing the background anxiety, belied as that claim may be by certain facts...)
