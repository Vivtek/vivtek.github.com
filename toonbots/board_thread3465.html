<strong>The 1 month prayer service</strong>
<P>As we approach 1 month of Toonbot abstinence, we should pause to reflect upon the joy of Toonbots past. We should look in hope to the Toonbots yet-to-be, and give a moment of appreciation to the bulk of work that has Saint Michael of the Wolverines so tied up. As it was before the internet, is on the web, and shall be in the global matrix of the future, in Boxjam's name, amen.
<P>Be sure to keep the offering plate moving.
<P>-Pope Tirdun

<P>oooh, carcajous - i like it! ('skunk bears' is fun too, but 'carcajou' has such a lovely exotic foreign sound) (altho - do you really want to encourage them to think of you as their plaything? i mean, the little ones are nice, but some of the bigger ones seem to get carried away occasionally)

<P>It's really getting to me, though so is the fact that humble self presently like continually bankrupt casino... broken. Great fall, long story... been at home for not quite week now, in wheelchair and with fractured right leg and arm for awhile, at least... Cards and wolverine tidbits are encouraged.

<P>good heavens, man, what did you do? (_please_ say the pickle joke wasn't so awful it caused you to throw yourself off something really high - i mean, it might serve michael right for leaving it up so long, when he had tirdun's and your contributions even (what happened to those, anyway?), but it really is too much of a sacrifice for you to make.) it sounds quite nasty and unpleasant - hope everything heals up well and _quickly_.

<strong>The Rise and Fall of the Jihad</strong>
<P>&gt; I'm sure mine needed tweaking, and tweaking involves time, and Michael
<BR>> seems to be short on that lately.
<P>Maybe you should send it to mouse, since she managed to submit something so flawless that he posted about it. She could tweak it. It could be a collaboration. It could smack of factionality amongst the famed Jihad.
<P>Then the other members of the Jihad could rise up in opposition of the mouse/Tirdun faction, and form their own faction called 'The People's Front for Toonbots Purity with Potluck Sundays Every Other Week' (or PftppSeow, cause that's a handy acronymn). And we could bang gavels and shoes as gavels, and call each other 'The greatest threat to Toonbotism the world has ever known'.
<P>I call dibs on bringing the lime jello for the first Potluck Sunday/Massacree of the mouse/Tirdun faction.
<P>In totally unrelated news, I'm so pleased spinclad has officially joined up! Even though I very rarely understand and got totally lost on the whole cloud thing.
<P>And poor Emsie! Geez. Get better!

<P>We shall overcome the evil PftppSeow EMPIRE! We shall stop it's insideous.. insidius.. dark creepy taking-over plan! Our children's children will make holidays to celebrate the day of our victory. Then later they'll move it to a convenient Friday or Monday to make a 3 day weekend so they can go on long car trips! Then they'll forget the true meaning and the greeting card companies will commercialize it to death and WalMart will start putting up &quot;Crush PftppSeow Day&quot; decorations for sale MONTHS in advance and &quot;Crush PftppSeow Day&quot; will probably be changed to the easier-remember-but-less-accurate &quot;Crushing Day&quot;, but THAT IS AT LEAST A FEW YEARS OFF!

<P>What's that? I can't hear you. I'm busy nailing my 98 Theses to the door of Michael's basement with a tack hammer.
<P>&gt; I'd excommunicate you...
<P>Ooooh. So, 300 years from now, when the Church of the True Faith of Toonbots decides that since they abolished the practice of Wolverine Indulgences 246 years ago, that they can finally re-communicate me, will you throw me a 'Busting Out of Hell' party?
<P>(People who are not the daughters of Lutheran ministers might not get that, I just realized.)
<P>&gt; i thought you could at least shoot death-rays out of your eyes
<P>You know what would be a really cool superpower? The ability to make penguins appear at will. Preferably ones that mangle english with impunity. They have figured in many comics to date, and almost always serve to distract the main characters from whatever they were doing. You could use the penguins to get the villain's attention while disarming their nefarious plot. Or alternately, you could use them to keep those pesky superheroes from totally bashing your ultimate weapon of mass destruction before you even get to take it on a trial run.
<P>Personally, I've always liked the villains better. They have better toys. Except Batman, but he's kind of villainous looking anyway. Well, but really, the Penguin had way better stuff. That floating duck boat thing? That rocked. And an umbrella with a boxing glove attached to it?
<P>You see what happens when I try to recreate brilliance.

<BR>> caused the whole schism in the first place. I blame the penguins.
<P>Those darn penguins. You should have a few theses on the penguins, just to round it out to an even 100.
<P>99: Penguins and all creeping birds that cannot fly shall be marked as &quot;unclean&quot; and must not be eaten. 100: Mark Twain's use of penguins in his short story &quot;Puddn'head Wilson&quot; is blasphemous and thus Twain should be branded a heretic and flogged with penguins. Or given a stern talking to.

<BR>> and thus Twain should be branded a heretic and flogged with penguins. Or

<P>Pardon, but for the record, Pudd'nhead Wilson was a novel, rather than a short story, significant for its use of fingerprints as a means of determining identities (the first major use of the technique in fiction, which may have contributed to the recognition of the values of fingerpriniting and expanding usage thereof in real life.) To the best of my recollection, no penguins were involved (though a pair of Siamese twins very nearly were, in an earlier draft, before Wilson himself entered the fray as a character and eventually bumped aside that aspect of the story.)

<P>I know... I know. I didn't expect anyone to much about the book, it tends to get lost in Huck Finn's shadow. Librarians have been giving me odd looks when I ask for works related to it.
<P>I'm doing a critical review of the book for American Lit II right now. It is a dark, twisted and exceptionally odd work. I'd really not recommend it as a &quot;light read&quot; to anyone, although it was a very telling glimpse into Twain's mood after Huck Finn. I think I can see where he was trying (very hard) to make the comedy of the Twins (especially given the end-notes) but it ends up being a very unhappy book.

<P>which is rather sad - although tom sawyer and huck finn were great, he wrote so many other good things.

<P>a lot of his later stuff is very dark - The War Prayer is probably most noted for it (it was considered too grim to publish until after his death) - but a lot of other short stories have a very negative view of humankind (for example, A Dog's Story (i think that's what it's called)) - and Letters from the Earth. I think much of this was related to the death of his daughter, but can't remember the timeline, exactly - of course, he had other tribulations as well. i'm rather surprised Pudd'nhead Wilson even got published, with the picture it gives of relations between the races. it is pretty explicit about the mental cruelty that slaves lived with.

<P>Pretty harmless. Not in relation to right *now* of course, but in relation to what we have come to take as normal in the last coupla decades.
<P>&gt; A Dog's Story (i think that's what it's called))
<P>Or, in fact, a Dog's Tale: http://www.classicreader.com/read.php/sid.6/bookid.252/

<P>Oddly, just read this one today, linked from the forum at James Randi's site (www.randi.org, highly recommended and *not* just because a Chopping Block toon was featured a couple weeks ago...)

<P>&gt; I think much of this was related to the death of

<P>The death of illness of his daughter, who had gone mad while he was in Europe, the epilepsy of his other daughter, culminating in her drowning death in the bathtub on Christmas Eve, the heart condition of his wife, which killed her (her doctors had restricted visits from Twain himself as too exciting; he was allowed to visit no more than five minutes per day for the last year of her life). The estrangement of his third daughter. The death by drowning of his brother.
<P>And of course a lifetime of exposure to the basic stupidity of humanity.

<P>actually, i have been trolling good old &quot;joy of cooking&quot; for penguin recipes - this could be an ideal solution for dealing with the UAPF (and an excellent centerpiece for the celebratory picnic - now that i think of it, your fried chicken recipe could probably be adopted)

<P>no, no, sorry - they'll never catch on (they lack the tongue-tripping fluidity of pftppseow - i just _love_ that - sort of a bronx cheer combined with a ricochet). no, i think you should join me and tirdun - they we can be an axis of evil (no, wait, we're the good guys...axis of non-evil? anti-evil? - axis of anti-evil!

<P>you do need to pay more attention to these things, jenn - i mean, if you'd ever really _looked_ at an atom close up, this wouldn't surprise you.

<P>It is indeed good and proper to count the occasional Pale, Wan Shadow with its original (but please mend well soon)... I wonder, does it require the hand and attention of the Meta-Blather-Meister to bring about? If so, could i request a special _exemption_ in spinclad again's case... such that, rather than consolidating vertically in a single count, i might expand horizontally (as it were), tentacle-like, into odd corners of the current standings? [You gotta believe: if it's not one conspiracy, it must be several more!] Then i can start posting as my titles, just to get them on the board...

<P>Thanks for the get well wishes, but for the record, I'm not the only one. Pooga (who we sadly seem to have lost contact with) was the first, when he began posting as his title, Pooga Poogissima, in addition to the run of the mill Pooga. Michael simply set the auto-whatsit to recognize all variants of Pooga, and the same occurred following an unusual yet exhilirating evening in January 2001, when both Napoleon and myself got caught up in conversing with each other with the occasional name variant to spice things up, and the following day or so Michael fixed it to recognize variants of Napoleon and Emsworth. However, in many other cases, where there's been slight variation in a poster's name or spelling, he usually hasn't bothered with it, probably because of the time involved. When he has the time and if he has the inclination, Michael might do so, but again, time is the operative factor, and considering what his pressures of work seem to be at present, humble self would recommend doing opposite ofdiving swimmers - do not hold breath.
