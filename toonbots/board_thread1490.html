<strong>Memento (the movie, that is)</strong>
<P>Has anybody else seen Memento yet? I just got back. I'm still not entirely sure who set up whom. It got 9.0 (!!!) on the IMDb. I'm not sure why. It's a good twist, yeah. And at least I didn't see any trailers, so I didn't already know the answer at the outset (like Sixth Sense, what a waste). So I enjoyed the movie, although it's left me in a really dark mood.
<P>I'm just ... not entirely convinced.

<P>You know, for someone who never gets to see any movies, you seem to have been... making up for a lot of lost ground in the past few weeks.

<P>My wife is feeling guilty for making me do all those slides. Hee, hee. And of course I saw Shrek with my daughter. Kids' movies are easy to arrange. There just aren't many worthwhile ones. Shrek was an exception.
<P>We took the kids to Jumpy Tiger Exploding Dragon, too (or whatever it was called) -- that was a trip. I had to read the entire movie out loud. And simultaneously explain parts in Hungarian or German, depending on who was confused. Quite the linguistic juggling act. The only real problem with that was that I got a real crick in my neck from leaning over the whole time.

<P>You know what I just noticed today? Like a few of the other really popular webcomics Bruno the Bandit has been translated into a few other languanges. In Bruno's case, the two languages are <a href="http://212.227.71.131/bruno/bb_heute.htm">German</a> and <a href="http://rpg.rulez.org/bruno/">Hungarian</a>! Granted, Sluggy has been translated into <a href="http://sluggy.home.dhs.org/">German</a> and <a href="http://rpg.rulez.org/sluggy/index.htm">Hungarian</a> as well, but in Bruno's case, those are the ONLY two alternate languages available. Completely off topic, but I though it was neat. :)
<P>(Michael, if you could make those messes above into working links, I would greatly appreciate it.)

<P>I'm thinking of translating FS into chechoslovokian and ugandan. Then, I'm going to start translating Toonbots on a seperate page. Any sugguestions for languages?
