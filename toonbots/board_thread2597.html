<P>Sigh. This one didn't come out as funny as I intended. Oh well. At least it was timely.
<P>Speaking of timeliness, don't expect much this week, as I'll be away from home part of it. And I kind of want to do something special for this next episode.
<P>Can anyone guess why?

<P>Depends on whether you hold off until the 20th for the next episode, or not :) (joking...)
<P>Since I'm guessing not, I haven't a clue, sorry... but then it's early in the morning.

<P>It's a week since your stairs fell down again!
<P>It's the anniversary of the wolverines!
<P>It's Indiana Day!
<P>It's the 100th toon! (or something like that. I'm reading comics right now, but when I'm done with that I definately have time to go back and count them by hand. Yessirree...maybe 150th or something!)

<strong>Re: 10/01</strong>
<P>Well, the first toon (blessed be it's holy prophet, Alric) was divinely created the 21st of October in the holiest year of 2000 (now, of course, year 0 TB). So, given your current rate of quasi-daily updates versus your historical average of 1 per week, there will be a 3 week fast and then a 1 year anniversary extravaganza. Hi-dilly-Tom-dilly-go.
<P>And lo, there was much gnashing of teeth and eating of high fiber breakfast cereals.

<P>Woot! I'm Cool Enough! Finally! Do you /know/ how hard I've worked to become Cool Enough?

<P>*waits for Emsworth to tell me exactly what body part I'm now missing*
<P>This display probably nulls and voids the Cool Enough designation, huh? Except in the Dominican Republic and where prohibited? What's 5% tax on Cool Enough, anyway?

<P>&gt; *dances with wolverines in joy*
<P>(Native) We call her &quot;Dances with wolverines&quot; (White Man) Really? -squints- Is that why she's all bandaged up? (Native) Yes. Yes it is. (White Man) Not the safest hobby. (Native) No. We had other names, like &quot;Shrill Cries of Pain&quot; but the &quot;Dances&quot; one sounded better, more mysterious. (White Man) Ah. This is going to be a really long movie with no social significance or historical accuracy, isn't it. (Native) -sighs- Yes. Yes it is. (White Man) Shoot.

<strong>cereal serial</strong>
<P>&gt; And lo, there was much gnashing of teeth and eating of high fiber
<BR>> breakfast cereals.
<P>see, we _are_ becoming general mills - Pickle Crisps, Time Loops, Subliminal Messages Crunch (i'm guessing it's a crunch, since the wolverines were eating it) -- and now a high-fiber version -- except it needs a name.
<P>[boy, _this_ is shaky ground....a high-fiber cereal that relieves the pain of waiting for the next 'toon......or maybe hurries the process along? - nah, think i'd better leave that alone]
<P>btw, michael, not to make you feel guilty or anything, but you realize that if you abandon us for 3 weeks we will likely just be lying around in little heaps of dispair when you get back (and all sleep-deprived what with the cereal crumbs in bed). by _my_ math, 49*2.01 = 98.49 - does this mean we get half a toon to tide us over? a vignette maybe?

<P>She's doing that math thing again. Someone make her stop. mouse, don't you know that math is hard? Barbie told us so, it must be true. Stop with the math stuff and go shopping with me. (I'm only saying this cause it fits in nicely with those early Snail Dusts, and that way we can make Napolean try on makeup with us. Cause I'm just that sadistic)
<P>Course, I'm up for the half a toon idea. Cause as everyone knows,
<P>if t = more toonbots
<P>and x = the square root of the forum divided by z
<P>and y = NEXT! WOLVERINES!
<P>and z = Hungarian Apes
<P>then 2t + x/y+z = The mall.
<P>There. Scientifically proven, just for you, the forum reader.

<P>I never said I was abandoning anybody for three weeks. Although it's not a bad idea. 100 strips, one year -- that's clean! No, no, no, this is just a fermata.
<P>And 49 weeks is 343 days, but October 21 through October 1 is 345. 345 / 99 is 2.008. So I rounded up to save a significant digit. Next installment is #100. I'm basically astounded at this point, but I'm stymied as to what's next.
<P>I had debated doing some fresh Toon-o-Matic development, except I really *don't* have time, unless I want to lose a customer or two. Which I can't afford. But then, another potential customer just showed up yesterday. Go figure. They want me to port the wftk (my workflow toolkit) to Java, which is nothing new. The difference is, they're talking about funding the work, at least in part. I told'em, hell YEAH I like that idea. Haven't heard back, though. Sigh.

<P>For a few days here, penguins seemed just the right motto for our new climate, but now... it's a whole new Octember... that was a brief autumn, it's summer again.
