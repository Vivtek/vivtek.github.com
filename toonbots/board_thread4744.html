<strong>Who missed me?</strong>
<P>Hey, folks! I'm back and ready for my ritual defenestration of return!
<P>Now I have to go back and read the year's worth of fabulous toons that I missed! Oh, the agony!

<P>welcome back! how are things with you? are you employed again?
<P>now for the news.....let's see, how shall i put this...
<P>well, it won't take you a real long time to go through the 'toon archives. (the forum has been _slightly_ more active.) michael is in europe (he _says_ he'll come back) and napoleon is in indiana (stalking michael, according to emsworth)- and both of them have been pretty quiet about things. so those of us still hanging in may have to come up with an unofficial sort of defenestration thingy - or maybe we could just throw you in a pool (it being summer and all).
<P>still, it will be great to have you back on the forum. hey, new goal for the jihad - we can become the only cartoon forum that doesn't actually have a cartoon!

<P>&gt; well, it won't take you a real long time to go through the 'toon archives.
<BR>> (the forum has been _slightly_ more active.) michael is in europe (he
<BR>> _says_ he'll come back) and napoleon is in indiana (stalking michael,
<BR>> according to emsworth)-
<P>Well, the primary reason was to move in with an online friend of dubious gentility, since he offered living quarters (and she had previously spent a spring break or two with him), and escape the bosom of her family, to say nothing of enjoying the lower tuition and invigorating new atmosphere at the local university. But being able to stalk Michael (having failed during her last visit) doesn't hurt.
<P>Oh, and I had leg surgery (the rod inserted after my last accident was finally removed, since bone had healed perfectly), but recovering fairly well. Still swollen, but the blisters caused by allergy to hospital tape turned into sores, which have more or less ceased pussing after several days and are finally healing normally!
<P>Oh, and next week I shall be off to Comic-Con (leaving on the 16th), and plan to meet mouse there. If we had been able to get in touch with you, we would have invited you too, but there's always next year!
<P>

<strong>Do Not Go Jenntly Into That Good Night</strong>
<P>&gt; Hey, folks! I'm back and ready for my ritual defenestration of return!
<P>&gt; Now I have to go back and read the year's worth of fabulous toons that I
<BR>> missed! Oh, the agony!
<P>If it makes you feel better, that should only amount to about 6-8 months at the most.
<P>Welcome home, Jenn! Been donkeys' years since we've seen you. How goes it? I assume the job situation has improved since we last met? Drop us an e-mail some time so we can keep in better touch. Been quiet around here lately, since Tim Bram sadly passed away last October, Tirdun left over personal differences, Napoleon and Chris have been mostly too busy to post (though I'll try to lure the former back to perform the proper return rituals), and Michael is currently incommunicado in Hungary.
<P>It's so nice to have you back where you belong!

<P>/me defenestrates gopher. Then Napoleon. Hey, Napoleon, sorry not to be very stalkable at the moment. If you're going to be in B-town much longer, my wife has officially reached her Hungary exposure limit (actually it's mother exposure -- she *likes* Hungary) and we might be coming back fairly soon. Early August, anyway. Will you still be around?

<P>I'm pretty sure my housesitter would have told me about this. She didn't report any sudden appearances of Mao Tse-Tung on the fence, either.
