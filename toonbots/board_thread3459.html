<strong>BoReD - need distractions</strong>
<P>After much mental gymnastics this morning (PeRl HurTs BraIn) I'm done wandering about the internet. Yay for boredom! Anywho, I figured I'd bug the wonderful jihad on a minor issue:
<P>I've lost my online comic bookmarks.
<P>Not a big deal, during the death and resurrection of my computer at work I somehow lost one of the files that Opera uses to store bookmarks. So my extensive and oft-out-o-date list of webcomics has vanished. Aside from reading Toonbots (and of course Snail Dust) what do you people READ?
<P>I've recovered the ones I remember, but hey, there's got to be more out there than the ones EVERYONE knows about. So feel free to sugguest things to read regardless of quality of art, level/type of humor, size of archive, etc.

<strong>Re: BoReD - need distractions</strong>
<P>jenn had a list of like 57 a while back - mine is shorter but keeps growing - in no particular order: chopping block, boxjam's doodle, triangle and robert, greystone inn, sluggy freelance, BRUNO THE BANDIT, nukees, freefall, schlock mercenary, sinfest, one over zero, gpf, user friendly, framed, and what's that otherone? runaway stars or something :^p
<P>i also like old comics - li'l abner, freckles and his friends, calvin and hobbes (not all that old, but a classic all the same), and popeye (at go graphics classic comic archives - he also has moon mullins, gasoline alley and krazy kat, but those haven't been updated in ages - and unfortunately his archive system seems to be in some sort of infinite loop, and i haven't found a contact)
<P>(and it's spelt &quot;anyhoo&quot;, as any pogo afficionado will tell you - sluggy has its points, but spelling is not one of them)

<P>yeah, i like a bunch of these too, and: avalon (for the fifty year old high-schooler in me), clan of the cats, college roomies from hell!, fans (owing to their big crossover last august), framed!!! and its relatives, rogues of clwyd-rhan, blotto street, goats, Zebra Girl (with gratitude for its escaping the wretched angelfire site with its great gory popup ads), ZWOL. sadly much more keen-centred than i would prefer. i am glad they are there supporting so much of the web toonity, with what looks to this reader like decent infrastructure... and yet more grateful to have a few good independents about making a go of it.

<P>Heh, the puzzle was supposed to be 1 week and run a little different, but some important family medical stuff came up and I had to stretch/pad/delay. :)
