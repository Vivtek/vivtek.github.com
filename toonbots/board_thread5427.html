<strong>Man....</strong>
<P>I used to be funny before 9/11 changed everything. (Sigh. I shouldn't look at all the old stuff on the archives and spare parts page and forum archives 'n' stuff.)

<P>well, you still have your moments. i must admit, the one that got me hooked on toonbots was after the 2000 election, but before it was resolved. i think the line that got me was something like &quot;the cartoonist might be more creative (or something) if the recent election had resulted in something - like an outcome&quot;
<P>...i have the feeling i just completely butchered that.
<P>anyway - always remember, if you look at them right, politics are hysterical!

<strong>Re: Man....</strong>
<P>&gt; well, you still have your moments.
<P>I really wasn't fishing for compliments, but I'll accept that one anyway.
<P>&gt; i must admit, the one that got me
<BR>> hooked on toonbots was after the 2000 election
<P>The one that had me was dot bot dot bot dot dot bot. That was gold. And I did like the Commie-Con, and the Pickle Crisp Massacree. Really, there were a lot of them (including the hurricane ones last month) where I found myself grinning ear to ear just putting them together.... I like that part.
<P>&gt; anyway - always remember, if you look at them right, politics are hysterical!
<P>Yeah, I thought of trying some political humor, but it's just not funny for me if people are dying. And I can't get past that part. The only way I have fun with this stuff is just staying away from anything important, and giggling about the flowers, essentially.
<P>Speaking of which (not) we've got commercial TV now -- that Skittles commercial, where the one kid says, &quot;What if this rainbow doesn't exist? What if we're just imagin----&quot; and falls from two miles up? That cracks me up every time I see it. It's just so lovely and understated and minimalist, and it doesn't get in your face. I wish they were all that good.
