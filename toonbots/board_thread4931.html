<strong>The Quiet American - 9.0</strong>
<P>This was a good flick with a well-written story. Word was that Michael Caine is expected to have an Oscar nomination for it -- which knowledge somewhat ruined the film for me, since I was asking myself the whole time when the Oscar-level material was going to come up. Sorry. I dote on Michael Caine, ever since his line in I can't remember which movie: when asked, &quot;He was your superior, wasn't he?,&quot; he replied, in the 100% perfect tone, &quot;No, he was my boss.&quot; Classic.
<P>Anyway, Michael Caine does his usual good work here, but nothing screamed at me, &quot;This guy is taking himself to new levels and needs an Oscar pronto.&quot; But -- wow -- of Brendan Fraser, this was absolutely true. I like Brendan Fraser a lot, too, since he's got that friendly face that makes him perfect for bubble-gum movies like The Mummy and Dudley Doolittle. In this movie, though, he was the very model of a modern American &quot;advisor,&quot; nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Especially in his final scene, he was perfect.
<P>Otherwise, the movie was a solid piece of cinematic work, with a subject material that sent continual shivers down my spine given the geopolitical events of the last year (which also marred my movie-going experience: I go to the movies to escape mundane reality, not to be reminded of the Idiots In Charge). Definitely worth a look, but in my own scheme of classification, this is not a movie which requires the big screen to be appreciated, as it's not an effects vehicle.
<P>It was a small enough cinema draw, by the way, that it was not synchronized, but rather subtitled, which was fortunate for me. Hungary has been synchronizing fewer movies lately, thank God.

<strong>Re: The Quiet American - 9.0</strong>
<P>*sigh* - this is another one on my list of 'should see' - but it sounds like this one i can wait for hbo to show.
<P>i _did_ finally get out and see one i've been wanting to - 'winged migration'. it's a nature film - so no plot, but some really beautiful photography - they did a lot of filming from ultralights, so they were flying right alongside the birds - so you definitely get a &quot;bird's-eye&quot; view.
<P>there were some disturbing scenes (so alas, i can't recommend it as totally escapist)- but also some funny ones (there was one of canada geese walking around the arizona desert - you could almost hear them saying to each other 'what the _heck_ are we doing here?'

<P>It was released last year in a very few (two? one on each U.S. coast. I caught it then, then again months later) theaters, I believe- and Mr. (Sir? Ah, ok- Sir. Nov. 16 2000 CNN posting.) Caine was nominated for Best Actor this year on the basis of this film, though he did not win. There was a note in the New Yorker before nominations, if I remember correctly, suggesting that the studio was treating the film very gingerly indeed out of concerns that it might be perceived as anti-American, releasing it in the minimum number of theaters necessary to qualify for nomination; it did achieve wider release afterward, yes.

<strong>Re: The Quiet American - 9.0</strong>
<P>hey, eric! long time, no ...post?
<P>i remember seeing something about fears of anti-americanism too - one resists feeling it should have been released widely on just that account (sorry - just been reading some of the iraqi blogs - i feel like i should e-mail these people daily just to say &quot;i'm sorry&quot;)
<P>it's not uncommon for studios to do a small release to make sure something gets in under the wire for oscar nominations - but it was probably a shame to just try to sneak this one in. (and no, i _still_ haven't seen it - i may have to break down and spring for a dvd player)
<P>
