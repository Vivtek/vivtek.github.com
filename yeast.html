<h2>AMISH FRIENDSHIP BREAD</h2><hr>
Do not refrigerate the batter!<br>
Don’t use metal spoons or bowls with this procedure!<br>
The lid may pop off your container during the 10 days.  Don’t panic, this is a good sign that you have healthy, happy yeast.<br>

Pour one cup of batter into each of three containers and give each to a friend with a copy of this recipe, or you can just have them get it themselves from http://www.vivtek.com/yeast.html.<p>

Unless you were just interested in growing a yeast culture, add the following to your remaining batter:<p>

<tr><td>1 cup oil</td><td>1 tsp. cinnamon</td></tr>
<tr><td>2 cups flour</td><td>1 tsp. vanilla</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 cup sugar</td><td>½ tsp. salt</td></tr>
<tr><td>½ cup milk</td><td>½ tsp. baking soda</td></tr>
<tr><td>3 eggs</td><td>1 cup nuts (optional)</td></tr>
<tr><td>1-½ tsp. baking powder</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Large box of instant vanilla pudding</td><td></td></tr>
</table></td></tr></table>

Stir with a wooden spoon for old times’ sake.  Pour into a well-greased and well-sugared loaf pan.  Fill the loaf pan only ¾ full.  The batter will be very thick at this point.  Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top.  Bake at 350° for 40 to 45 minutes.  Use a toothpick to test for doneness (if it comes out dry, the bread is done, in case you didn’t know the doneness test.)
<p>
If you are a chain letter believer, then remember that the starter has to come from someone else, so don’t save any!  Ask one of your friends to give you some back!  For those of you irritated by chain letters, keep in mind that at least nobody can email you this starter, which provides a natural limit on its proliferation, otherwise the whole planet would be hip deep in batter within a couple of months.
