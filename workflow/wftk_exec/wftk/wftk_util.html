The command-line utility is first of all a convenient way to test the library after compilation.  But in addtion to that,
it provides a dandy way for shell scripts to interact with workflow (not the least of which is to enable scripts to start
processes.  Cool stuff, man.)  It also lets you interface wftk with <i>anything</i> that can do a system call.
