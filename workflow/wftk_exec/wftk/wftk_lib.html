The wftk core library, defined here, is the core workflow functionality of the whole wftk system.  Everything
else just supports this stuff, basically.  It's implemented as a library so we can build it into other systems.
<p></p>
The library consists of: <ul>
<li> Basic workflow functions.
<li> HTML presentation functions.
<li> Datasheet repository functions (datasheet load/save).
<li> Places to put adaptors.
</ul>

<strong><font size=+1>Adaptors</font></strong><br>

The core engine uses the following adaptors:<ul>
<li> <code>config</code>: Configuration
<li> <code>dsrep</code>: Datasheet repository.
<li> <code>pdrep</code>: Procdef repository.
<li> <code>user</code>: User/permission module.
<li> <code>db</code>: Database interface.
<li> <code>notify</code>: Notification mechanisms.
<li> <code>script</code>: Scripting languages.
<li> <code>datatype</code>: Data types.
<li> <code>debug</code>: What to do with debugging output.
</ul>

The point of these adaptors is to create as flexible and modular a system as possible.  The
<a href="http://www.aolserver.com">AOLserver</a> database driver system has been a great influence on
me here -- with AOLserver it's almost trivial to write a database driver to allow seamless (well, ideally)
access to database functionality from scripts.
<p></p>
I guess I could be a little clearer about some of those adaptors, though.  The datasheet repository,
for example, is where datasheets are stored.  The procdef repository is where process definitions are
stored.  In the prototype, each of these was implemented as a fairly simple system of files and
directories.  In the case of the procdef repository, however, there are already good solutions to things
like version control -- CVS is a good example.  Ideally, if CVS is available, the procdef repository
should be able to use it for "real" version control and also for all the integration possibilities
which are already there.  Thus the procdef repository is implemented as an adaptor.
<p></p>
The configuration adaptor is unique to a given installation, and could be as simple as a bunch of
compiled settings, or as complex as the location of an XML file to be loaded based on some kind of
context.  On Windows it will read the Registry.
<p></p>
The user adaptor allows the core engine (and its CGI implementations) to ask a directory who the
current user is and what permissions the current user has.  Naturally, the <a href="../user/index.html">user
module</a> included with the wftk is the preferred one, if that's the right word, but once I've
learned something about LDAP I'm sure I'll want to integrate with it.  More to the point, if your
organization already has something in place that can do user authentication and permission
definitions, then wftk should work with it.
<p></p>
The db adaptor provides an interface to a task manager.  The overview talks about the difference between
core workflow and task management.  Suffice it to say here that the db adaptor allows us to specify a
set of databases to which current status of tasks and processes can be written so that other systems
can also use that information.
<p></p>
The notification adaptor provides a way to adapt wftk to existing messaging protocols.  I'm implementing
email and a database-based task manager notification methods, but you can easily imagine others, like
Outlook integration or alpanumeric pagers.
<p></p>
The scripting language adaptor is going to be one of the most exciting parts of wftk.  Particularly once
I drop this engine into Python, it's going to be nice to be able to run Python snippets from inside a
process.  The same thing applies to Perl, Java, Tcl, or what have you.  (OK, Java might be a little
trickier since it's compiled.  I'll see how that all works out.)  The default "scripting language" will
be something very simple to allow basic data value manipulation without having to compile a scripting
engine into the basic configuration.
<p></p>
Likewise, the data manipulation facilities will be extensible via a datatype adaptor.  The details of
this (like the scripting adaptor) are pretty fuzzy at this point.
<p></p>

<strong><font size=+1>Data sources used</font></strong><br>
Besides its commands, the engine has two sources of input: the process definition and the
datasheet.  The procdef stores information about a class of processes; the datasheet stores
information about the current instance of that class.  Both documents are XML documents, and
the core engine interprets these documents using James Clark's
<a href="http://www.vivtek.com/expat.html">expat parser</a>, a stable and fairly simple parser.
<p></p>
Commands can be performed either by calling individual action functions, or passing a <i>very</i>
simple list of commands in an XML format to a general command doer thingy function.
