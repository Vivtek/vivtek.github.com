Our library will consist of the <code>wftk_lib.c</code> file, defined here, along with
at least one file for each of the adaptors listed earlier.  Most of the nitty-gritty
will of course be in the various adaptor definitions, the most important content of
this file being the procdef interpreter.

Really the HTML presentation stuff should be a completely different library, and 
probably I'll end up doing that at some point.  It makes sense (to me) to stash
it here for now.
