Interpreting commands and interpreting process definitions in order to complete tasks and advance processes
is, of course, the whole point of workflow.  And really, it's not all that hard.
Let's start with the individual actions, and then we'll do a little command list interpreter.  Command lists
are simply XML structures containing command elements which correspond to calls to the individual action
functions, so there's not a lot to that.
<p></p>
The way I'm implementing state bears mentioning.  Each active task has an entry in a task queue.  As tasks get
activated, they are added to this queue.  The queue is an element in a state, which is itself a top-level
element of the datasheet.  Thus the state and queue are in-memory structures during interpretation, but
get saved out to the datasheet repository after each round of processing.
<p></p>
A processing round is initiated by calling one of the action functions.  Of the four, 'create' and 'setvalue'
don't initiate processing, but 'complete' and 'abort', since they change task status, do -- if an active
task is closed, then processing proceeds by removing it from the queue, finding its description in the procdef,
and activating whatever comes next (or doing notifications, or closing sequences, continuing loops, whatever.)
<p></p>
The action functions in this section are the chief component of the UI (along with wftk_task_requirements).
In general, to "do workflow" a calling application will take the following steps:
<ol>
<li> Call <code>wftk_action_create</code> to create a datasheet.
<li> Call <code>wftk_action_define</code> to attach a procdef to the datasheet.
<li> Call <code>wftk_task_requirements</code> with NULL as the task ID, in order to find out
what the process requires for initial startup data.
<li> Call <code>wftk_action_setvalue</code> zero or more times to write the initial data.
<li> Call <code>wftk_action_complete</code> with NULL as the task ID.  This starts the process.
</ol>

Now the process is fully active and tasks are active.  To continue, the application completes tasks as they're
ready.

Creating a datasheet is really simple.  In fact, it's incredibly simple as far as the core library is
concerned: we just call the datasheet repository adaptor and poof!  It happens.  The result is the
new datasheet, and the repository makes sure that the ID for the datasheet will be unique.

If there's a problem, NULL is returned.

<i>Definition of wftk_action_define</i><br>
Attaching a process definition to a datasheet is likewise simple (actually it's almost the
same thing, with a different adaptor.)  You might be asking why it makes sense to split datasheet
creation and attachment to a procdef into two steps -- why not just define a datasheet from the
procdef directly?  The answer is that ad-hoc processes may <i>have</i> no definition, but they
still need data storage, and at some point, an ad-hoc process may be attached to a procdef for
completion.
<p></p>
Note the use of a value holder for the version: a value holder is just a little HTML element like
this: &lt;value name="name" value="value"&gt;.  It's a cheap and tawdry way to encapsulate
values without having to worry about managing buffers.  The current version of the XMLAPI does
a lousy job of buffer management, but when I improve it, the improvement will help us out
here, too.
<p></p>
It's been said that any sufficiently complex program implemented in C contains most of an
implementation of LISP.  (The implication being that you might as well save time and write
LISP to start with.)  I'm starting to believe this.  But I <i>still</i> think this code is
much more readable than the equivalent LISP would be.

OK.  Here's some actual workflow.  When we complete an action, we do two things, basically: we
update any databases which are associated with the process, and we mark the task as complete in the
queue.  Then we run the procdef (if any) until it all blocks again.

<i>Definition of wftk_action_setvalue</i><br>
To complete our bag of tricks, we have the setvalue function.  All this does is to take a named value
and write it to the datasheet.  If necessary it will create the value.  In the prototype task manager,
values could be associated with either the process as a whole or with individual tasks.  At this point
that seems a needless complication, especially if tasks now know their own requirements.  So for now,
anyway, we're just going to have process values.  That may change in the future.
