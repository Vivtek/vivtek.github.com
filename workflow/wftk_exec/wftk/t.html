There is no include file for this, as the wftk_internals takes care of definition.  So I'll just cut to the chase
with the source file -- and all on this one page, too!
<p></p>
The whole thing, as I envision it, is pretty dumb.  An API consists of a table of functions, a table of names of the
functions, and the number of entries in each table.  Each function takes a vararg list of parameters, and returns an
XMLAPI pointer.  There is no error checking done by the adaptor code.
<p></p>
This is pretty much a poor man's ActiveX; the point of ActiveX is to make interchangeable implementations
of adaptor APIs, and this is one of the reasons I actually respect Microsoft's programming work.  Of course, given the
resources, I would have done a better job.  And in fact this module is a first implementation of something that could
someday be a better job.
<p></p>
So.  We've got two main functions to define: <code>wftk_get_adaptor</code> retrieves a pointer to an adaptor structure
by type and name.  The type is an integer defined at compile-time.  The other function, <code>wftk_call_adaptor</code>,
naturally provides a call interface for functions in the API.

typedef struct wftk_adaptor WFTK_ADAPTOR;
typedef XML * (*WFTK_API_FUNC) (WFTK_ADAPTOR * ad, ...);

struct wftk_adaptor {
   int num;                /* Supplied by the adaptor. */
   XML * parms;            /* Supplied by the caller. */
   char * names;           /* Supplied by the adaptor. */
   WFTK_API_FUNC * vtab;   /* Supplied by the adaptor driver. */
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

Notice that one-element array of API entries.  That's an old trick I learned from some of the DOS and 16-bit Windows
APIs.  The wftk_adaptor structure is malloc'd (or simply declared) to be whatever size is necessary, but the struct
can't represent that.  This is the dodge you use to make everybody happy.  The only drawback is that the compiler
doesn't like it for literal values.  We're going to get around that by hard-coding a different definition of the
wftk_adaptor structure for each adaptor we define.  A little ugly but functional.

<p></p>
The way this works is that each type of adaptor has a list of function names that drivers implement.  Each driver has
a list of functions implementing those names.  When the calling program calls <code>wftk_get_adaptor</code>, it first
determines the type of adaptor (using the type number), then splits the specifier on a colon to get the name of the
driver to use.  Anything after that optional colon is passed to the initialization function to build into the arbitrary
parameters (which are of course an in-memory XML structure.  I'm really getting attached to that data structure.)

<p></p>
How the actual drivers are found and initialized is up to the config module; in the first run, it'll just be hardcoded.
