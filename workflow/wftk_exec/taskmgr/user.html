The user functionality consists of two things: the most important is of course the
code to be executed before each function in order to cause the login box to pop up.
This uses <code>ns_conn authuser</code> to see if a login has already been supplied; if not,
a 401 return is used to pop the box up.
<p>
The other portion is of course a couple of screens for maintenance of the user table: a list,
a user-update function, a user-add function, user delete, and a screen to be used to request
a user ID.  (The request is anonymous and creates an inactive user record.  The record must
then be activated by an administrator.  This would be a great place to use a workflow.)

<a name="check">
<i>Checking authuser</i><br>
Checking for the authuser is pretty straightforward.  This code is executed at the beginning
of each screen.  It invokes the user utility of the wftk in a command-line mode in order to check
authorization.  If the password matches, that utility returns all the attributes of the user,
one per line, with name separated from value by a colon.  A future version should, of course,
use a Tcl extension incorporating the user library, but this should work and was naturally
faster to code.
<p></p>
The information retrieved from the user module is placed into an <code>ns_set</code> structure.
This structure is like a Perl hash -- you'd think that a Tcl array would be exactly the same,
except that <code>ns_set</code> doesn't raise an error when you try to retrieve a nonexistent
key; it just returns a blank, which is more convenient in most cases in my humble opinion.
