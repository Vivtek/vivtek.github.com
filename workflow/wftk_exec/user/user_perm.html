I nearly forgot to include this function in the API -- isn't that weird?  Anyway, the whole
point of all the preceding work is to be able to ask of a given user and a given object,
whether the user has permission to a given action on that object.  To determine this, we'll
walk the user and group trees until we find the object (or don't) and a permission level which
matches.
<p></p>
I've decided that rather than leave the permissions completely open to module interpretation,
it will be simpler to define a couple right at the outset: "own" means automaticallly that the
user gets any permission.  "write" is greater than "view", and those two are the only official
permissions defined.  (I.e. if I have write permission, and the question is whether I may view
an object, then the answer is always "yes".  That might be a little too simple, but I think in
practice it will work.)
<p></p>
Note that since permissions are completely arbitrary strings, a module is perfectly free to
define anything at all as a permission.  For the wftk, "activate" makes a lot of sense as a
permission, for instance.  It's just that the user module won't know anything special about
those permissions.
<p></p>
This is by far our most complicated function.
<p></p>
There are three things which are "magic" about permissions.  First is that permission "own"
qualifies you for any permission.  Second is that group "admin" has "own" on everything.
Third is that everybody belongs to group "everybody", so that granting some privilege to
group "everybody" makes that privilege public.  And fourth (OK, so I thought up another one
during subsequent development) -- as I was saying, fourth is that any permission at all is
sufficient for "view".

Now the variant, <code>user_perm_group</code>, which just takes the name of a group which owns the object
in question.  (Thus having the named permission on the group will automatically count as having (at least) that
permission on the object.)  This saves a great deal of overhead if we can assume that objects always are
owned by single groups, which works well for the task manager.

OK, we need to mop up some details now.  First, let's formalize that comparison between
permissions: if the user has "own", then the user has any permission.  If the permissions
are the same, the user has permission.  Otherwise, no permission.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30 bgcolor=eeeeee>&nbsp;</td><td width=100%>
<pre>int _user_perm_cmp (const char * perm1, const char * permission)
{
   if (!strcmp (perm1, "own")) return (1);
   if (!strcmp (perm1, permission)) return (1);
   if (!strcmp (permission, "view")) return (1);
   return (0);
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

Um...  OK, that was all the help I needed, I guess.
