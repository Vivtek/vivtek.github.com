Hi.  Welcome to SCUMF.  As you can see, there's nothing to see yet.
<p>

The SCUMF, or Shared Collaborative Ultimate Metacartooning Framework, consists of the following:
<ul>
<li>The <a href=toon-o-matic.html>Toon-o-Matic</a>, a facility which takes the XML definition of a cartoon, a character library, and builds a graphic image of the cartoon.
<li>A workflow framework which organizes several processes of dynamic content:
  <ul>
  <li>Creation, collaborative modification, and publication of cartoon episodes using the Toon-o-Matic
  <li>Random invocation of algorithmic codelets which modify episodes
  <li>An ongoing tournament comparing episodes for quality
  <li>Creation, collaborative modification, and publication of cartoon arcs (sequences of episodes)
  <li>An ongoing tournament comparing arcs for quality
  <li>Forum, commentary, and blog support for the community
  </ul>
</ul>

There are many goals in all this:
<ul>
<li>Having fun with Web cartooning even when you can't draw
<li>Having fun with power tools in general
<li>Seeing whether the evolution of humorous cartoons will happen
<li>Showcasing my workflow toolkit in a way no other workflow system has been showcased
<li>[something]
<li>Profit!!!
</ul>

Here's a very rough to-do list:
<ul>
<li>Get Toon-o-Matic working with proper modules and in a wftk context for retrieval of characters, fonts, etc.
<li>Complete enough of the Perl wftk wrapper to enable Toon-o-Matic queue handler to be written in Perl
<li>Construct the workflow framework for the toon compilation machinery
<li>Commence alpha testing of toon compilation using Jihad as guinea pigs
<li>Construct workflow framework for collaborational tools: blogs, comments, tracking, suggestion/to-do tracking
<li>Commence alpha testing of collaborational framework using Jihad
<li>Commence beta testing with small group of sufficiently cool established Web cartoonists
<li>Release to public
</ul>
