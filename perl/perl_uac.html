<div class="title">Perl and Windows UAC</div>
Windows security is an attempt to balance two needs - on the one hand, Windows
is a user-centric operating system that is intended to be operated by
your grandmother without the need for dedicated support staff, while on the other,
there are roughly as many Windows machines connected to the Internet as
there are stars in the Orion Arm, and if they don't have <i>some</i> kind
of security, the botnets on them will bootstrap to sapience and we will
all be dead.
</p><p>
The result, for now, is UAC.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control">UAC (User Account Control)</a>
is Microsoft's way of letting Windows machines run in user mode and still
permit "dangerous" things like installers to enter Administrator mode.
When they do this, the entire screen goes dark and a prominent dialog asks
the user if they really want the program to change their system. The key is
that the user can't miss this behavior. It probably helps.
</p><p>
What requires a program to run as Administrator? To start, any write
access to the Registry. And there's just one little problem with that when
you're using Perl: Win32::TieRegistry (best practice for Registry access)
requests write access by default. So when I was building my little
utility script for TRADOS Registry entries, working out just how Win32::TieRegistry
was supposed to work took a disproportionate amount of time (leading, in
fact, to this very article). When you're just wanting to read the Registry,
pro tip: just request read access.
</p><p>
But let's assume you <i>do</i> want to modify the Registry. To run a program
as Administrator, you have to request a UAC pop up. And the recommended way to do that is
to make a manifest (which is a simple XML file) and embed it into the program's
executable, or at least place it in the directory next to that executable.
Well, but wait a minute. The Perl executable is not your program, is it?
And the vast majority of Perl programs don't need admin mode, obviously, so popping
up UAC for every Perl call would be ridiculous - not to mention that calling this
from the command mode starts the program in a separate console and process anyway.
</p><p>
All in all, a mess.
</p><p>
But there are a couple of ways to do this for scripting languages. One is to create a
shortcut to call the script for you, then click "Advanced" and check the
"Run as administrator" button. You can even run that from the command line with
"start my_shortcut.link". Your script will run in a separate console, but it will
pop up a UAC box and work.
</p><p>
It's easy enough to create a shortcut from Perl using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32::Shortcut">Win32::Shortcut</a>, but that only wraps
the IShellLink interface, which doesn't expose that admin flag (because it was
designed before UAC was invented). To gain access to that flag, you need the
IShellLinkDataList interface (but of course), and set the SDLF_RUN_AS_USER flag
(but of course). And of course there's the whole sticky wicket of having to put
another file next to your script, which is just messy and prone to error
</p><p>
I wanted a technique I could automate quickly and easily, so that wasn't it.
Some more poking turned up the
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.06.utilityspotlight.aspx">Elevate Command Power Toy</a>.
There's a download link at the top of that article that installs a bunch of
little apps for running different things with elevated privileges - the ones
you want are "elevated.cmd" and "elevated.vbs". Toss those into a directory in
your path, and you can now just say:
</p><p>
<pre class="code">
c:\projects\trados_languages&gt; elevate perl trados_languages.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
This was already much better! It can be used for anything at all, so if I want
to edit a system file or something, I can just call it on my editor. Very flexible!
</p><p>
Looking a little closer, though, it turns out that the key to that power toy is
a single call: the <pre>Shell.Application</pre> interface exposes <pre>ShellExecute</pre>,
which can be called with the application (perl), a string containing arguments (the
script and any arguments it wants), the local directory (which can be left blank to
use the current directory), and a verb.
</p><p>
It's not documented (thanks, Microsoft), but that verb can be "runas" to pop up the
UAC dialog before running the program identified. Essentially, this is what the shortcut
does for you.
</p><p>
At any rate, I've wrapped up this solution into a convenient module
called <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32::RunAsAdmin">Win32::RunAsAdmin</a>, called like this:
</p><p>
<pre class="code">
use Win32::RunAsAdmin qw(force);

... everything else ...
</pre>
</p><p>
Seriously.  Just put that at the top and your script will pop up a UAC box and run in
a separate process as Administrator. Here's what it does:
<ul>
<li>Call <tt>Win32::RunAsAdmin::check</tt> to see if we're in admin mode already.
If so, we're done.</li>
<li>Otherwise, determine the Perl executable, calling script, and arguments.</li>
<li>Call ShellExecute to restart the calling script as Administrator.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
It's still not perfect. The elevated privilege is attached to the Perl executable,
not the script, and so a separate console is started, which makes it incompatible
with shell-style usage. But for simple utility scripts, it's a convenient
way to bootstrap into Administrator.
</p><p>
(For the record, I believe the only way to run an elevated script as a shell-style
script would be to open an elevated console to start with, then just call the script.) 
</p><p>
For more details about the API this module exposes (for example, if you simply want
to run some other program as Administrator instead of rerunning the current script),
check its CPAN documentation <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32-RunAsAdmin">here</a>.
</p><p>
At some later date, I'd like to look a little closer at manifests and other UAC-related
topics, and those might go into Win32::RunAsAdmin, but this much gets me what I wanted
to achieve today.
</p><p>
<div class="title">Detecting elevated privileges</div>
</p><p>
It's pretty cheesy, but the way I learned about UAC in the first place was when
Win32::TieRegistry failed because it requests write access to the Registry by default.
There is probably a more standard way of detecting elevation in the running process,
but this works. I just did this:
</p><p>
<pre class="code">
   use Win32::TieRegistry qw( ::KEY_ );

   my $key = Win32::TieRegistry-&gt;Open( "LMachine", {Access=&gt;KEY_READ()|KEY_WRITE()} );
</pre>
</p><p>
If <tt>$key</tt> is undefined, you're not running with elevated privileges. I've
exported that as <tt>Win32::RunAsAdmin::check</tt>.
</p><p>
<div class="title">Running using Win32::OLE</div>
</p><p>
Since this technique only works through the Shell object, you've got to invoke it using
Win32::OLE. Fortunately, that can be done in two lines:
</p><p>
<pre class="code">
   use Win32::OLE;

   my $shell = Win32::OLE-&gt;new("Shell.Application");
   $shell-&gt;ShellExecute ($executable, $args, $directory, 'runas');  # undef is fine for the directory
</pre>
</p><p>
And that's really just about all that's of any interest in this module; the rest is
pretty vanilla Perl stuff. As always, drop me a line if you have any questions or suggestions.
