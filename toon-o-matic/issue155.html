AIDS is one of the most serious diseases, which influences people’s life.
</p><p>
AIDS has damaged millions people’s life, and more people are continuing to be suffered by this dangerous illness. AIDS stands for “Human Immunodeficiency Virus”, it is a virus which infects, the cells of a human body, therefore a person may become ill( UNAIDS, 2008). HIV is very hazardous virus, for the reason that it directly influences the immune system, further it has several of methods that makes the virus to avoid the body’s protection system. This results in entering the virus the human body and the immune system is not able to remove fully the virus from the body. At this stage other viruses can easily attack human body and a person become seriously ill, so at his point it is said that the HIV is transferred to AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). AIDS is very dangerous condition, at this period an organism has very little power to fight against any type of infection. Due to the fact that AIDS is today the most serious phenomenon, which ruthlessly takes away people’s lives, society has been taking steps towards eliminating this problem; however the truly reliable solution is still to be found. 
AIDS can pass from one person to another (WHO, 2008), so there are different causes for this disease. First of all, that is the unsafe sexual intercourse with the infected person. Sexual interaction without protection or not using various protective measures is unreliable, because the virus can pass to the body, of the partner by sexual fluids. The next reason is using the infected blood. In decades many people have been infected with HIV by using the transmission of blood in hospitals which contained this virus. For instance all over the world the blood donations are strictly controlled.  The last and the most widespread cause is the injection of drugs. People who are injecting drugs are also exposed by the infection, often because they share their injecting items. Unfortunately AIDS is transmitted even through small amount of the blood. AIDS as a serious disease has major impact on life condition of people. Initially in most countries which have a large proportion of infected people the Health Service is under the pressure. For instance in Africa, people infected by HIV/AIDS capture the half of the area of the hospital offered for patients. Government-Funded research in South Africa ha suggested that on average, HIV-positive patients stay in hospital four times longer than other patients. Unfortunately, in most African poor areas there are not enough places in hospitals, so many patients are offered the medical treatment just on the last stage of the disease. Moreover as the number of infected people increase, the demand for the healthcare professional increase. But still exist another problem, many healthcare workers are directly infected by the virus. For example in Botswana, Africa during 1995-2005 about 17% of healthcare workers lost their jobs, because of being infected. ( WHO, 2006).It is hard to believe that this dangerous disease effected the children’s life condition The virus caused not only the children to lose their parents sometimes their childhood too. In many countries where the percentage of infected people is large, often both parents have HIV-positive. Resulting, many children left without care of their parents and many others are sent to orphan houses. As the ratio of the infected orphan children rise, it demands for more care from the governmental side. One of the major impacts of the HIV/AIDS is the impact o economy of the country. Due to the expenditure on the treatment of disease, it has made more difficult for the countries to cope with the financial crisis. One significant way by which HIV/AIDS impacted the economy, by decreasing the labor supply, because of the death rates and illness.  Consequently as the tax falls the governmental income also declines and it becomes more difficult to make large investments in tackling HIV/AIDS.
The first solution is to find medication that will help to protect the immune system from virus. Such kinds of medications slow down the transformation of HIV to AIDS. And they can keep people’s body healthy for many years. Sometimes, the antiretroviral medication seem to stop working after a number of years, but in other cases people can recover from AIDS and live with HIV for a very long time. But they have to take very strong medication every day of their lives, sometimes with very unpleasant side affects. The side affects of the medications are more serious and can have major impact on health or quality of life, even they are threatening to life. If a person started to use antiretroviral medications, they must be taken every day, because every missing dose increases the risk that the drugs will stop working. It is very important if people using this medication get all the help they need, in order to decrease the impact of the side effects. Another disadvantage of this solution is that, the medication’s cost is very high and most people are not able to buy them, because the HIV/AIDS mostly occupies the area of poor developed countries.
Conducting different trainings by NGOs for youth is the second solution for tackling this problem. There were mentioned different causes for this problem as unprotected sexual relation, injection of drugs, in such kind of activities according to statistics mostly young generations are involved. It is true to say that, these results are because youth is not aware of the causes and consequences of the disease. That is why, the interference of NGOs is very important. But on the other hand, the weakness of this solution is that such kinds of activities are free, I mean, government do not allocate money to the recruits  who work with adults and children or their salary is poor, therefore they can work without enthusiasm and youth might not listen to them. Besides, private companies who also work with this problem are not too much in Kazakhstan. Also, our direction pay little attention to this problem, thus it is difficult for people to help each other by themselves.
To conclude, despite the fact that AIDS is one of the biggest problems the world is facing today and nobody is beyond its reach, researchers have to seek the medicine which can protect human’s immune system, and everyone should know the basic facts about HIV and AIDS. Therefore the best solution is conducting different progarmmes and conferences by NGO organizations, for young people, because it would be affordable for youth. I strongly recommend the society not be aside of but participate actively in the actions that are done by NGOs and government for tackling this problem.
