As is perhaps obvious from the application's name, lpml takes a literate programming presentation which is coded in markup language.
The XML in question is somewhat questionable, perhaps, as the presentation items allow free embedding of arbitrary markup,
but I really don't care, as the whole thing does what I need it to do, which is define pieces of code contiguous with
nicely formatted documentation.  If somebody else knows more about XML and can tell me how I can specify arbitrary markup
in an element, then maybe I'll be able to write a DTD.  Otherwise I guess we're just kinda out of luck and I'll have to continue to think of this as a generic markup language product with no
X in it.
<p>
I've been checking my XML for well-formedness, anyway, so that's good.  The alpha script, since it generates HTML, has some
extra little tidbits for turning well-formed XML into valid HTML.
<p>
Here are the elements I'm using so far:
<ul>
<li><a href="#litprog"><code>&lt;litprog&gt;</code></a>
<li><a href="#format"><code>&lt;format&gt;</code></a>
<li><a href="#object"><code>&lt;object&gt;</code></a>
<li><a href="#item"><code>&lt;item&gt;</code></a>
<li><a href="#piece"><code>&lt;piece&gt;</code></a>
<li><a href="#variant"><code>&lt;variant&gt;</code></a>
<li><a href="#insert"><code>&lt;insert&gt;</code></a>
</ul>
They work as follows:
<ul>
<a name="litprog">
<b><li><code>&lt;litprog&gt;</code></b><br>
This is simply the root element.  Takes no attributes.
<br><br>
<a name="format">
<b><li><code>&lt;format name="NAME"&gt;</code></b> <i>(Added 5/6/00)</i><br>
The format element defines a named format.  Each item may then specify which format it wants to use to generate its page.
If no other format is specified, then the 'default' format is used.
<br><br>
<a name="object">
<b><li><code>&lt;object name="NAME" language="LANGUAGE" item="START" variant="VARIANT"/&gt;</code></b><br>
The object element defines an output file.  The list of output files is available to the index page in the <code>[&#35;#objectlist#&#35;]</code>
tag.  The file will be written to "NAME" relative to the current directory, and the tangle will start at the item called
"START".  All pretty obvious.
<p>
The language will come later, probably after QDMT is integrated with the application.  It
will specify the base language of the object as a default language for each item along the
line.  Knowing the language of a stream will allow tangle to generate indices of defined
data structures and so forth which weave will then be able to use to organize the code.
But right now it's still blue-sky.
<p>
The variant feature isn't done yet either (although I'm working on it.)  What this will do is to allow selection of certain pieces
and rejection of others when tangling multiple objects from a single presentation.  If a piece is shared by two variants, then
it won't have a variant tag.  I think the variant feature will be pretty cool, but that remains to be seen.  Watch this
space for further details.  I want to develop QDMT in both C and Perl using a variant
structure, but again I don't have much time to do that and I <i>do</i> need QDMT in C, and
quickly, so that will all have to wait for later.
<br><br>

<a name="item">
<b><li><code>&lt;item name="NAME" label="LABEL" format="FORMAT"&gt;</code></b><br>
Each main item defines a page of documentation; subitems may follow each main item.  A subitem is defined as an item whose
name has a period in it, so I may have an item "tangle" and a subitem "tangle.tangle_one".  Subitems <i>must</i> follow
their parents immediately or you will have some odd behavior.  The documentation and code for a subitem is appended to
its parent's page under an italicized heading, and a link anchor is created using the post-period part of its name, so that
in the above example, the page "tangle.html" will have a link anchor <code>&lt;a name="tangle_one"&gt;</code>.
<p>
The list of items is available in the <code>[&#35;#itemlist#&#35;]</code> tag; subitems are in a second
level of list.  Each item's list heading contains a link to its documentation page, so it's an effective table of contents.
Eventually I'd like to do some more formatting of the table of contents, but that's pretty far down on my to-do list at
the moment.
<br><br>

<a name="piece">
<b><li><code>&lt;piece variant="VARIANT" add-to="ADDTO"&gt;</code></b><br>
Items define the documentation, and pieces define the code output.  Each piece must be embedded in an item or it gets roundly
ignored.  (Yes, yes, a DTD would simply make that illegal but remember that the alpha version doesn't <i>really</i>
understand XML.)
<p>
If a piece has a variant attribute, then it will only be included in objects for which it matches the variant spec.  It will
be filtered out of others.  This will allow a single presentation to produce specific code for, say, Unix and Win32 variants
of a single codebase.  For finer control over variants, you can also embed a <code>&lt;variant&gt;</code> tag into a piece.
<p>
The other application for the variant system is documentation of porting projects.  Both variants (even in widely different
languages) can thus be tangled from the same presentation, while patterns shared by both may be shared explicitly.  Again,
once the feature is complete and I've tried it on a certain project I have in mind (involving Common LISP and Java, so we're
at least talking about widely different languages) then we'll see how effective the whole idea is.
<p>
The add-to attribute is optional; if present, it causes the piece to be added, not to the
currently active item, but to the item named.  This makes it convenient for presenting
cleanup code adjacent to allocation code, for instance.  I'm still not entirely convinced
it's a good idea, but I'm reserving judgment until I've tried it out in a couple of
presentations.
<br><br>

<a name="variant">
<b><li><code>&lt;variant name="VARIANT"&gt;</code></b><br>
When used within a <code>&lt;piece&gt;</code>, makes a part of the piece subject to suppression.  So if the object I'm
currently tangling is variant "unix" and I encounter a variant "win32" in the current piece, the contents of that tag will
not appear in the object.
<br><br>

<a name="insert">
<b><li><code>&lt;insert name="NAME"/&gt;</code></b><br>
Used to do literate programming in the traditional sense, of course.  The occurrence of the tag is replaced with the contents
of the named item.  This operation is recursive and is called <i>tangling</i> if you're not familiar with literate programming.
Come to think of it, if you <i>are</i> familiar with literate programming, it's still called tangling.
</ul>

Well, that's the lot.  As I implement more stuff, if it impacts the element set at all, I'll update this page.  I hope.
