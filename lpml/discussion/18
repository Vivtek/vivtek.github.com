<P>LOOK LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE TODAY, I NEED THAT MONEY. BUT IS IT LEGAL IN THE U.S.? AND I REALLY CANT TAKE A CHANCE OF LOSING ANY MORE MONEY. IVE LOST MY WIFE IN A UGLY DIVORCE AND HALF MY TIME WITH MY CHILDREN, NOT TO MENTION MY JOB OVER THIS SITUATION. I NEED A BLESSING AND HAVE BEEN PRAYING FOR ONE, IT WOULD BE NICE IF THIS WAS IT. I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS CAN YOU HELP ME OUT? &gt; !!!PLEASE READ THIS! ITS LIFE CHANGING!
<P>&gt; I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while
<BR>> back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came
<BR>> across an article similar to this that said you could MAKE THOUSANDS of
<BR>> POUNDS within weeks with only an initial investment of £30! So I thought,
<BR>> &quot;Yeah right, this must be a scam&quot;, but like most of us, I was
<BR>> curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that if you send £5.00 to each
<BR>> of the 6 names and address stated in the article. You then place your own
<BR>> name and address in the bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in
<BR>> at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch that was it. So
<BR>> after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about
<BR>> trying it. I figured: &quot;what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and
<BR>> £30.00, right?&quot; Then I invested the measly £30.00. Well GUESS
<BR>> WHAT!?... Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was
<BR>> shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in.
<BR>> In my first week, I made about £2500. SHOCKING RIGHT? By the end of the
<BR>> second week I had made a total of over £10,000! In the third week I had
<BR>> over £1,000,000 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I
<BR>> have made a total of just over £1,500.000 and it's still coming rapidly. I
<BR>> KNOW THIS ALL SOUNDS UNBELIEVABLE BUT PLEASE I CAN ONLY PERSUADE YOU SO
<BR>> MUCH OVER A KEYBOARD AND A SCREEN BUT PLEASE BELIEVE ME THIS REALLY WORKS
<BR>> AND REMEMBER THE ONLY LIMITS IN LIFE ARE THE LIMITS YOU PLACE ON YOURSELF!
<BR>> BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND FOLLOW ME IN THIS UNBELIEVABALE JOURNEY PERSONALLY
<BR>> I AM ONLY 19 AND I HAVE MADE OVER A 2 MILLION POUNDS IN OVER A PERIOD OF 2
<BR>> MONTHS NOT EVEN DAVID BECKHAM OR MICHAEL JACKSON EARNS THAT MUCH! SINCE I
<BR>> HAVE EARNED ALL THIS MONEY I HAVE BOUGHT A FERRARI SPIDER ASTON MARTIN
<BR>> VANQUISH AND I PLAN TO GET A LAMBORGINI! THIS ALL SEEMS LIKE A DREAM BUT
<BR>> BELIEVE ME MY LIFE HAS JUST CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS IVE
<BR>> ACHIEVED SOMETHING! IF YOU DO AS THIS LETTER SAYS YOU CAN SHARE MY DREAM
<BR>> AS WELL! It's certainly worth £30.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than
<BR>> that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly,
<BR>> WHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so
<BR>> you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that
<BR>> if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making more
<BR>> money than you thought possible by doing something so easy!
<P>&gt; Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or download
<BR>> it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in!
<P>&gt; It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only £30.00 (Plus postage)
<P>&gt; IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal;
<BR>> and it is 99% no risk - it really works!
<P>&gt; If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive
<BR>> extraordinary dividends.
<P>&gt; PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and 1,000,000 or more
<BR>> can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of
<BR>> the honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue its success
<BR>> by carefully adhering to the instructions.
<P>&gt; You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your
<BR>> product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in the business
<BR>> of developing Mailing Lists.
<P>&gt; STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each
<BR>> piece of paper &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot; Now get 6
<BR>> UK £5.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the
<BR>> bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next,
<BR>> place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now
<BR>> have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above
<BR>> phrase, your name and address, and a £5.00 bill. What you are doing is
<BR>> creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a
<BR>> legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a
<BR>> little sceptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all.
<BR>> So I checked it out with the Post Office and they confirmed that it is
<BR>> indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses: DO EXACTLY
<BR>> AS IT SAYS BELOW DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING!! WATCH THE MONEY ROLL IN!!!!!!!
<BR>> #1) Robert Smith, 25 Greenford Road, Harrow, RT5 8UI
<P>&gt; #2) Olga Chenko 23 Fernbank Avenue, Sudbury, Wembley, Sa3 8ui
<P>&gt; #3) James Romero 98 Abercorn Crescent, Harrow, Ha8 8io,
<P>&gt; 4.) John Scott 55 Welbeck Road, Harrow, HA3 8JM
<P>&gt; 5.) Ali Hussain 4 The Drive, Uxbridge, London, UB10 8AF
<P>&gt; 6.) Mick Mazotra 1 southview, london, NW10 1RB
<P>&gt; STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the
<BR>> other names up 1 place (#2 becomes #1, #3 becomes #2, etc...) and add YOUR
<BR>> name and address as number 6 on the list.
<P>&gt; STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close
<BR>> to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least 200
<BR>> newsgroups. (There are hundreds of thousands!) All you need is 200, but
<BR>> remember, the more you post, the more money you make! You won't get very
<BR>> much unless you post like crazy.
<P>&gt; This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec.
<BR>> 1302 &amp; 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for
<BR>> yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, and again.
<P>&gt; PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the
<BR>> honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering
<BR>> to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the
<BR>> program will continue and the money that so many others have received will
<BR>> come your way.
<P>&gt; NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on
<BR>> a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES
<BR>> that you are truly providing a service.
<P>&gt; so, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six
<BR>> members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer
<BR>> with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so
<BR>> that when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving
<BR>> thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only £30.00 (£5.00
<BR>> for each of the first six people listed above) Send it now, add your own
<BR>> name to the list and you're in business!

<BR>> everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular
<BR>> group, click the post message button. You're done with your first one!
<BR>> Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different
<BR>> newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about
<BR>> 30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST
<BR>> IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST a MINIMUM OF 200**
<BR>> that’s it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within
<BR>> days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of
<BR>> mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a
<BR>> name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL
<BR>> THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT. **
<P>&gt; Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me £5.00 make the MINIMUM 200
<BR>> postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of
<BR>> the original 5, that is another £125 for me, now those 25 each make 200
<BR>> MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in
<BR>> an additional £625.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the
<BR>> MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will
<BR>> make an additional £3125! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625
<BR>> persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only
<BR>> receive 5 replies that just made me £15,625!!! Those 3,125 persons will
<BR>> all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still
<BR>> 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive £78,125, with an
<BR>> original investment of only £30.00! AMAZING! HAVING SAID THAT I ONLY
<BR>> EXPECTED A LITTLE BUT I GOT A MILLION POUNDS IN MY FIRST 2 MONTHS WICH WAS
<BR>> WAY BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS! When your name is no longer on the list, you
<BR>> just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another
<BR>> £30.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And
<BR>> start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that
<BR>> thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and
<BR>> reading these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you
<BR>> afford £30.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said,
<BR>> &quot;what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So
<BR>> what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new
<BR>> honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and
<BR>> newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at
<BR>> 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the
<BR>> actual internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really
<BR>> work.
