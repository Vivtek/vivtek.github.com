<P>The wftk task manager is a largish example of literate programming style. The literate documentation helps me maintain and extend it, and I wrote it literate from the ground up.
<P>I'd appreciate any suggestions on formatting, presentation, etc. The formatting in LPML is still hard-coded (although I have some plans along those lines...)
<P>Please take a look.
