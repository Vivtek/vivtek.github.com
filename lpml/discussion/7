<P>I dislike the statement &quot;LPML /is/ a Perl script.&quot;
<P>A language can not be a perl script. It should first and foremost be a specification. So, where is the specification of LPML?
<P>Then, reading the site, I had no idea what LPML was all about. I was looking for a /short/ (4096-8192 characters) tutorial introduction. Did not found one.
<P>No specification, no introduction, this means: nothing for me to read.
<P>Or have I overlooked something?
