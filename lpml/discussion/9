<P>!!!PLEASE READ THIS! ITS LIFE CHANGING!
<P>I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could MAKE THOUSANDS of POUNDS within weeks with only an initial investment of £30! So I thought, &quot;Yeah right, this must be a scam&quot;, but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that if you send £5.00 to each of the 6 names and address stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured: &quot;what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and £30.00, right?&quot; Then I invested the measly £30.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about £2500. SHOCKING RIGHT? By the end of the second week I had made a total of over £10,000! In the third week I had over £1,000,000 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over £1,500.000 and it's still coming rapidly. I KNOW THIS ALL SOUNDS UNBELIEVABLE BUT PLEASE I CAN ONLY PERSUADE YOU SO MUCH OVER A KEYBOARD AND A SCREEN BUT PLEASE BELIEVE ME THIS REALLY WORKS AND REMEMBER THE ONLY LIMITS IN LIFE ARE THE LIMITS YOU PLACE ON YOURSELF! BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND FOLLOW ME IN THIS UNBELIEVABALE JOURNEY PERSONALLY I AM ONLY 19 AND I HAVE MADE OVER A 2 MILLION POUNDS IN OVER A PERIOD OF 2 MONTHS NOT EVEN DAVID BECKHAM OR MICHAEL JACKSON EARNS THAT MUCH! SINCE I HAVE EARNED ALL THIS MONEY I HAVE BOUGHT A FERRARI SPIDER ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH AND I PLAN TO GET A LAMBORGINI! THIS ALL SEEMS LIKE A DREAM BUT BELIEVE ME MY LIFE HAS JUST CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS IVE ACHIEVED SOMETHING! IF YOU DO AS THIS LETTER SAYS YOU CAN SHARE MY DREAM AS WELL! It's certainly worth £30.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, WHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy!
<P>Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in!
<P>It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only £30.00 (Plus postage)
<P>IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works!
<P>If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.
<P>PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and 1,000,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions.
<P>You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists.
<P>STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot; Now get 6 UK £5.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a £5.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little sceptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the Post Office and they confirmed that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses: DO EXACTLY AS IT SAYS BELOW DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING!! WATCH THE MONEY ROLL IN!!!!!!! #1) Jane Knight 14 Harrowdene road, Wembley, SA5 9JH
<P>#2) Robert Smith, 25 Greenford Road, Harrow, RT5 8UI
<P>#3) Olga Chenko 23 Fernbank Avenue, Sudbury, Wembley, Sa3 8ui
<P>4.) James Romero 98 Abercorn Crescent, Harrow, Ha8 8io,
<P>5.) John Scott 55 Welbeck Road, Harrow, HA3 8JM
<P>6.) Ali Hussain 4 The Drive, Uxbridge, London, UB10 8AF
<P>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other names up 1 place (#2 becomes #1, #3 becomes #2, etc...) and add YOUR name and address as number 6 on the list.
<P>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (There are hundreds of thousands!) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy.
<P>This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 &amp; 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, and again.
<P>PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way.
<P>NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service.
<P>so, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only £30.00 (£5.00 for each of the first six people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business!
<P>-----DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS--------------
<P>Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory. Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' files and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back to. Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST a MINIMUM OF 200** that’s it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT. **
<P>Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me £5.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another £125 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional £625.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional £3125! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies that just made me £15,625!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive £78,125, with an original investment of only £30.00! AMAZING! HAVING SAID THAT I ONLY EXPECTED A LITTLE BUT I GOT A MILLION POUNDS IN MY FIRST 2 MONTHS WICH WAS WAY BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another £30.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford £30.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said, &quot;what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work.
<P>
