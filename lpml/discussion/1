<P>OK, I've been on this crazed drive adding discussion groups here and there on my site using WebBBS. Please -- discuss. Use LPML. Tell me where it sucks and where you think it's neat. Check out and read some of my litprog examples and critique them.
<P>Let's bring literate programming into the mainstream, shall we?
