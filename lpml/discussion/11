<P>&gt; Good day, This article I've written is all about the fact where I earned
<BR>> an ASTOUNDING amount of money in less than a month and I've decided to
<BR>> share or reveal the secrets behind making big bucks in the Mail Order
<BR>> Business.
<P>&gt; So all money seekers, read this carefully.
<P>&gt; Hi, I'm 24 years old and I make more money than my parents and so can
<BR>> you&quot; Turn $6.00 into $60,000...read this carefully to find out how!!
<P>&gt; Reading this could change your life
<P>&gt; I found this on a bulletin board like this one and decided to try it. A
<BR>> little while back, I was browsing through several newsgroups, just like
<BR>> you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you
<BR>> could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial
<BR>> investment of $6.00! So I thought, &quot;Yeah right, this must be a
<BR>> scam&quot;, but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway,
<BR>> it said that you need to send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address
<BR>> stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the
<BR>> bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups.
<BR>> (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over,
<BR>> and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured:
<BR>> &quot;what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, right?&quot; Then
<BR>> I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!... within 7 days, I started
<BR>> getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but
<BR>> the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By
<BR>> the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000.00! In the
<BR>> third week I had over $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my
<BR>> fourth week and I have made just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in
<BR>> rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than
<BR>> that on the lottery!!
<P>&gt; Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works....
<BR>> Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the
<BR>> information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the
<BR>> directions exactly, that you will start making more money than you thought
<BR>> possible by doing something so easy!
<P>&gt; SUGGESTION: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download
<BR>> it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! It's easy.
<BR>> It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage).
<P>&gt; IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal;
<BR>> and it is virtually no risk - it really works!!!! If all of the following
<BR>> instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.
<P>&gt; PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more
<BR>> can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of
<BR>> the honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue it’s
<BR>> success by carefully adhering to the instructions. You will now become
<BR>> part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not
<BR>> solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in the business of developing
<BR>> Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for
<BR>> quality lists. However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary
<BR>> to the income which is made from people like you and me asking to be
<BR>> included in that list.
<P>&gt; FHERE ARE 5 EASY STEPS TO GET STARTED
<P>&gt; STEP# 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each
<BR>> piece of paper &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot; Now get 6
<BR>> US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the
<BR>> bill will not be seen through the envelope ( Please make sure that the
<BR>> bill would not be noticed in the envelope to prevent thievery). Send out
<BR>> US $ DOLLAR, so it would be more acceptable.
<P>&gt; STEP# 2: Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them
<BR>> properly. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of
<BR>> paper stating the phrase, &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot;,
<BR>> your name and address, and a $1.00 bill.
<P>&gt; What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You
<BR>> are requesting for a legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like
<BR>> most of us, I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal
<BR>> aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
<BR>> (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!
<P>&gt; Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses below:
<P>&gt; 1) Bob R.
<P>&gt; 11 Phillips Lane
<P>&gt; Lake Groove, NY 11755-2623
<P>&gt; 2) Almeric Battiste
<P>&gt; P.O. Box 450035
<P>&gt; Kissimmee, Florida USA 34745
<P>&gt; 3) Phonexay Khounvongsa
<P>&gt; 5003 Lakecrest Dr.
<P>&gt; Shawnee, KS, USA 66218
<P>&gt; 4) Tamara Ortiz
<P>&gt; 2471 Newsom Rd.
<P>&gt; Bellville, TX. USA 77418
<P>&gt; 5) Love Carter
<P>&gt; #2 Jericho St.,
<P>&gt; Victoria Ville Homes, Antipolo City,
<P>&gt; Philippines, 1870
<P>&gt; 6) Tara Roach
<P>&gt; 3033 Dogwood Dr.
<P>&gt; Troy, Oh 45373
<P>&gt; STEP# 3: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the
<BR>> other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as
<BR>> number 6 on the list.
<P>&gt; STEP# 4: Copy this article. Change anything you need to, but try to keep
<BR>> this article as close to original as possible.
<P>&gt; STEP#5: Now, post your amended article to at least 200++ newsgroups. (I
<BR>> think there are close to 2.4million groups) All you need is 200, but
<BR>> remember, the more you post, the more money you make! This is perfectly
<BR>> legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341,
<BR>> US Postal and Lottery Laws or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also
<BR>> in the code of Federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
<BR>> states; &quot;a product or service must be exchanged for money
<BR>> received.&quot; The simple note in the letter, &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR
<BR>> MAILING LIST&quot;, makes it legal because you are paying for exchange of
<BR>> a service, (adding the purchasers name to his mailing list) for a $1.00
<BR>> fee.
<P>&gt; ==========================================
<BR>> ==========================================
<P>&gt; Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works....
<BR>> Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the
<BR>> information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the
<BR>> directions exactly, that you will start making more money than you thought
<BR>> possible by doing something so easy!
<P>&gt; ==========================================
<P>&gt; IMPORTANT: Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need
<BR>> money, you can use it again, and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program
<BR>> remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the
<BR>> participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it
<BR>> this way. If you are of integrity, the program will continue and the money
<BR>> that so many others have received will come your way.
<P>&gt; NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on
<BR>> a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES
<BR>> that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to
<BR>> wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as
<BR>> each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members
<BR>> will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one
<BR>> dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when
<BR>> your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of
<BR>> dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of
<BR>> the first six people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the
<BR>> list and you're in business!

<BR>> postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back

<P>&gt; GOOD LUCK to all and please play fairly and reap the huge rewards from
<BR>> this, which is tons of extra CASH. By the way, please DON'T try to deceive

<BR>> any. This is the fairest and most honest way I have ever seen to share the
<BR>> wealth of the world without costing anything but our time!!! You also may
<BR>> want to buy mailing and e-mail lists for future cash. Make sure you print
<BR>> this article out RIGHT NOW! Also, try to keep a list of everyone that
<BR>> sends you CASH and always keep an eye on the newsgroups to make sure
<BR>> everyone is playing fairly. Remember, HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.
<P>&gt; IMPORTANT: If you're not interested to my article, (don't want instant
<BR>> cash?), please pass this message to anyone who wishes quick money. Thank
<BR>> you so much. =======================================
<P>&gt; Copy this article from the text box and paste it on a blank notepad file.
<P>&gt; Change or edit anything you need to but keep the article as close to
<BR>> original as possible
<P>&gt; ALSO REMEMBER: SEND YOUR $1 OUT TO EVERYONE ON THE LIST, EVEN IF THEY ARE
<BR>> NOT FROM THE U.S.
<P>&gt; NOW, THE WHY PART
<P>&gt; Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example) .
<BR>> So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now, each of the 5
<BR>> persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my
<BR>> name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is
<BR>> another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my
<BR>> name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00!
<BR>> Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name
<BR>> at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $626.00!
<BR>> OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200
<BR>> letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just
<BR>> made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to
<BR>> 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still ONLY 5 persons per 200
<BR>> newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original investment of
<BR>> only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just
<BR>> take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to
<BR>> names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting
<BR>> again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that thousands of people
<BR>> all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles
<BR>> everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it
<BR>> really works?? I think so... People have said, &quot;what if the plan is
<BR>> played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances
<BR>> of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest
<BR>> people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are
<BR>> willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users,
<BR>> every day, with hundreds of thousands of those joining the actual
<BR>> internet!!!
<P>&gt; Remember, Play Fairly and Honestly and this will work for you
<P>&gt; By the way, please DON'T try to deceive people by posting the messages
<BR>> with your name in the list and not sending the CASH to the rest of the
<BR>> people already on the list, you will NOT get any. This is the fairest and
<BR>> most honest way I have ever seen to share the wealth of the world without
<BR>> costing anything but our time! You also may want to buy mailing and e-mail
<BR>> lists for future cash. Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW!
<BR>> Also, try to keep a list of everyone that sends you CASH and always keep
<BR>> an eye on the newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly.
<BR>> Remember, HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. You don't need to cheat the basic
<BR>> idea to make the CASH!! GOOD LUCK to all and please play fairly and reap
<BR>> the huge rewards from this, which is tons of extra CASH.
<P>&gt; IMPORTANT: If you're not interested to my article, (don't want instant
<BR>> cash?), please pass this message to anyone who wishes quick cash.
<P>&gt; Thank you so much.
