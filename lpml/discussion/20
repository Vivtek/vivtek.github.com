<P>$5 into $21000 in two weeks over and over From: Matt Date: 30 Nov 2003
<P>Comments Hi, I thought I should share this amazing story with everyone. Last summer my daughters 13yr. old friend that lives across the street told me she had $21,000 in her bedroom closet and didn't want her parents to find it. She asked me if I could hold it in my bank account for her. I was totally shocked by all this. The first thing I asked of course is, Are you serious and where the heck did you get $21,000? She explained to me that her and a friend started a &quot;mailing business&quot;. and all the money is being sent to her grandmothers house. Her Grandmother is in the Hospital and she gets the mail on the way home from school. She thought if her parents found out about the money she would get in trouble. She didn't think that she would still be getting all this money in the mail. She said she just wanted to help her parents with the bills sense her mom can't work anymore. Anyway, she went on to explain to me what she actually did to get all this money and I was very skeptical until she brought me a shoe-box packed with $5 bills. She told me there are three more at the house and if I could just deposit the money in her parents bank account without them knowing it would solve all her problems. She then asked if I could use any extra money. Of course like anyone I said sure, who can't these days. She said ok then I will add your name to the list a sent it out tomorrow. Do you want your money to come to your house in the mail she asked. Still being very skeptical, I said sure why not. To make a long story short... Two weeks later envelopes full of money started pouring into my mailbox. more and more each day and haven't stopped sense. I also noticed that her dad hasn't been going to work either. I figuring by now, if you have been reading this letter your are very curious yourself so, below are the details of what you need to do to get started yourself ... FROM THE NEEDING TO THE NEEDING These are trying times and so many of us are unemployed, single parents, unwell or otherwise in DIRE NEED OF MONEY, to make ends meet. &quot;God helps he that helps himself&quot;; well &quot;The Letter&quot; provides the tool to do it! Are you one of us; in dire need of money to make ends meet? If you need to make a few thousand dollars really quickly, then please take a moment to read and understand this opportunity I am sharing with you.
<P>This is the fastest &amp; easiest Money making program you will ever do. Complete it in One hour and you will never forget the day you first received it in the mail or online. Beg, borrow or ste...no don’t steal it, but get a $5 note, and send it to one person to participate in this &quot;INTER NEED PROGRAM&quot; This program has only three levels, not four, five or six, as in many other programs. It is very realistic and so fast . Because it is so easy, the response rate for the program is now as high as 50 %. You will receive your reward in about fourteen days. Just in time for next month's bills!!! What you need to do is to mail 20 copies of the program (not 200 or more as in other programs), perhaps to people who send you their programs. These are already believers (and this program is better and faster) or post it in 20 chat forums or message boards on the internet. Do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE RIGHT NOW! Just give one person $5. That's it! That's all! Follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you should have seen at least $7,000, because so many people will respond, due to the low investment, speed, and huge income potential. We are presently at a 50% response rate! That's a $10,000 return. So let's all keep it going and help each other in these tough times.
<P>HERE ARE THE SIMPLE DETAILS 1 Write your name on a blank sheet of paper, add your own address and this message: &quot;Please ad me to your list&quot;. Next fold it around a five-dollar bill and send this to the first name on the list. Only the #1 person on the list gets your name and a five-dollar gift in the first round. 2. Retype the list only, removing the first (#1) name from the list. Move the other two names up and add your name to the list in the third (#3) position. 3. Paste your newly typed list neatly over the old one and make 20 copies of this letter and send to 20 prospects or post 20 on the internet on message boards or chat forums. Well there is no more to do. It's so easy! One hour! That's it!
<P>Do it right away; don't mull it over. Your name will climb position at a Dizzying geometric rate. When your name reaches the first position in a few days, it will be your turn to collect your gifts. The gifts will be sent to you by over 1,500 to 2,000 people like yourself who are willing to invest $5 and one hour to receive $7,000 in cash. Your entire investment will be about $5 to $10, including the $5 gift you sent the first name on the list, envelopes, copies, and stamps. That's all! In return there will be a total of $7-10000 in your mailbox in $5 bills, in two weeks. Consider that!
<P>CAN I DO IT AGAIN, WHEN IN NEED? OF COURSE!! No mailing lists to buy and wait for. No further trips to the printer or copier. And now you can do it again over and over with your regular group of gifters. Why not? Each time you receive an MLM offer in the mail, respond with this letter! HONESTY AND INTEGRITY MAKE THIS PLAN WORK, BUT REMEMBER ACT FAST AND GET MONEY FAST. COPY THE NAMES CAREFULLY AND SEND YOUR FIVE DOLLARS TO THE FIRST NAME ON THE LIST! 1.Dale Lundgren 1541 Wiltsey Rd SE #228, Salem, OR 97306 2.Stanley Brooks 10235 Monarch Drive St. Louis, MO 63136 3. Matt Ganoza 3819 WheatGrain Lane, Fairfax, Va 22033 P.S. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!
<P>Have any questions about this? just email me at Mattganoza@yahoo.com with your question and Ill answer it immediatly, or email me at Marinesniper_900@hotmail.com
