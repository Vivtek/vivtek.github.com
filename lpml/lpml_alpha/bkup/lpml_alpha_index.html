<h2>lpml, alpha version Perl script</h2>
<hr>
This is the first run at the <a href=/lpml.html>lpml (Literate Programming Markup Language)</a>.
It is a simple Perl script,
doesn't do much fancy yet -- but it works.  My eventual plans for it are extensive, and I
don't expect any of the code now in existence to survive long.
<p>
I'd be overjoyed if someone else found this system to be useful.  If you do, please
<a href=mailto:michael@vivtek.com>tell me about it</a> and of course feel free to update me
with any changes you might have made to the code.
<p>
Table of contents:
(unresolved tag itemlist)


The completed code (a Perl script) is available <a href=lpml_alpha.txt>here</a> as a plain
text file suitable for download.  To install it, just replace the first line (which is the
path to my Perl interpreter) with the path to your own Perl interpreter. 
I haven't written any user documentation except a <a href=/lpml/language.html>list of the
elements I use</a>.  The overall setup of a presentation isn't described anywhere yet.
<p>
You can, of course, study <a href=lpml_alpha_xml.txt>the XML-ish code</a> I used to generate
this code and documentation.  This is pretty thin user documentation but soon I hope to augment
it.
