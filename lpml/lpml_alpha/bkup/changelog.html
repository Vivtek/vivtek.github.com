I'm going to cut off this
particular version whenever I complete <a href=http://www.vivtek.com/xml/tokenizing.html>qdmt</a>
but until then I've got a few things I want to build into even this primitive little app.
<p></p>
<ul>
<b><li>Initial application functional</b> <i>3/21/2000</i><br>
The initial version could (just barely) tangle and weave.  It could process itself and it
produced readable documentation.  Qualifies as literate programming in my book, anyway.
<b><li>Second pass</b> <i>3/26/2000</i><br>
Did a few things.  Changed the highlighting of code segments in woven documentation by
sticking that little grey bar next to them.  Eventually that sort of thing should be done
with some sort of map (or better yet, lpml should work with DocBook SGML.)  Adding subitem
functionality.
</ul>

Here's a list of things I want to introduce before I do better XML tokenization:
<ul>
<li>Hide non-display items (like the cleanup item from this very project.)
<li>Variant support (to define objects which share some items but differ in others.)
<li>Single-page presentations (right now, you need at least two pages, as the index page
and the code pages are forced to be separate.)
</ul>

And then there's the further future:
<ul>
<li>Version control and documentation.
<li>Real XML tokenizer (QDMT).
<li>DocBook SGML instead of HTML output.
<li>Management beyond tangle (i.e. something on the make level.)
<li>Active items (generated from data structures aside from text, like database queries.)
<li>More sophisticated integration with my other <a href=/content_management.html>content
management</a> toolset.
</ul>

Plenty to do.  Maybe I'll get some of it done sooner or later.  Watch this space for further
details.
