This is LPML alpha, a Perl rendition of a quasi-XML-based literate programming system.

The files included in this zip are:
lpml.pl        - the processor itself.
lpml_alpha.xml - the XML used to generate the processor.  Run
                    lpml.pl lpml_alpha.xml
                 and lpml.pl will attempt to write itself (and probably fail due to locking.)
*.html         - the documentation generated from the XML.
blank.xml      - a handy starter file for new projects.
