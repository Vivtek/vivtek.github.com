<h3>Glasnost and perestroika</h3>
Vivtek is committed to changing the software industry.  Our customer model is radically
different from those of other companies.  We give away knowledge for free, we make our products
as cheap as possible to support our operation, and we involve the customer.  Scan on down the
page to see how new this really is, and take a look at any of our product home pages for more.
<br><br>
But it's not all just perestroika.  As a look at a product home page will also tell you, we
strive to be completely forthright about our products.  We tell you exactly what people like
and don't like, and what we are trying to do about it.  We give you a rundown of the products
in competition with ours, and why we think you might like ours anyway.  We'll tell you our
prices right on the page, because we have nothing to fear.
<br><br>
Nor do you.  We have a money-back guarantee on our products.  If you don't like it, don't keep
it.  But tell us why!  We'd like to change it, after all.
<h3>Source code availability</h3>
Even better, the full source code of each product is browsable from its home page, using our own
literate programming facility.  This means that while you can't use the code in your own
projects, you certainly can see how things are done, and you can very easily assess the
complexity of enhancements yourself.  This greatly offsets the expense of customization, so that
we can offer customized versions of products very easily.  And if for any reason we decide to
discontinue a product, or if Vivtek should become defunct (hey, we're not stupid, it's the
nineties and these things happen), then you will get the full source code of any Vivtek product
affected, delivered via email.
<h3>Cash back</h3>
Besides knowing at any time the exact planned schedule for bug fixes and enhancements to
products, you have even more involvement at Vivtek, and we mean <i>real</i> involvement.  When
you purchase a Vivtek product, you become a part owner and a distributor of that product.  This
means that you first of all get a small portion of every subsequent sale of that product, and
that you get a larger portion of the sale price of any copy of that product which you actively
sold.  Since all Vivtek products have freely distributable versions, this means that this is
shareware with a vengeance.  Go ahead and share it as often as you like, and get some cash back
for a change.
<br><br>
But there's more.  If you are the first person to discover a bug in a Vivtek product, you get a
bonus portion of sales.  If an enhancement that you propose later becomes incorporated in a
standard version of a product, you are part owner of the enhancement, and you get a proportional
share of sales.  If you propose a whole new product, the same thing follows.  In all cases, of
course, we decide the proportions (see the legalese on this).
<br><br>
And there's even more!  If you join our distributed developer program (the developer isn't
distributed, just the ... oh, never mind, you know what we mean), then you can even make changes
to our products, download those customized versions, and test them on your own site.  In all
cases, we track the changes and do the compilation, and we own copyright to the change, but
if you fix a bug, you get paid.  If we sell your enhancement, you get paid.  And if someone has
posted a bounty on a bug, you get paid even more.
