<div class="title">Milestones in Early Peanuts</div>
I've been reading the early Peanuts strips (waaay before the characters took on their current forms)
and it's remarkable the sense I'm getting of novelty.  A lot of the charm
of Peanuts in later years was the predictability, that reliance on
decades of shared history - but the starting years of the strip are a lot
more generic (that is, the kids are more generic, able to stand in for "Anykid")
and a lot more creative on a day-to-day basis.
</p><p>
Charlie Brown starts out as a <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/08/30">much more normal kid</a>
than the mellow philosopher
and loser he gradually came to represent.  He hated baths.  He 
<a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/01/10">taunted girls and ran laughing</a>.
Or was <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1953/06/14">just plain mean sometimes</a>.
His catchphrase for bad social experiences
seems to have been
<a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/09/22">That's the way it goes</a>, and instead of
"Good grief!" he seems to have preferred <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/02/15">Great Scott!</a>
And girls <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/11/01">liked him</a>.  (But
could still <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/11/11">be capricious about it</a>.)
</p><p>
Snoopy was originally Sherm's dog.  Maybe.  He tends to show up wherever
he's needed, and he seems to have his own house - Charlie Brown
<a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/09/04">mows his lawn</a>
for him because he can't do it himself.  Sometimes
<a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/10/14">Sherm has him on a leash</a>, but
maybe he <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/11/13">lives with Patty</a>
(in her pre-Peppermint incarnation).  Or maybe
<a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/11/25">with Charlie Brown</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/11/07">Adults could be heard</a>.
And the characters are just <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/06/01">not the same at all</a>, sometimes.
(I find that particular one really very charming.)
</p><p>
The original few months had only four characters: Charlie Brown, Sherm, Patty, and of course Snoopy.
Snoopy has a <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/04/17">run-in with a bird</a>
that I suspect may evolve into Woodstock eventually.
</p><p>
So anyway, as I read through the early opus,
I thought it would be fun to record some landmark dates, as
"Charlie Brown firsts".
</p><p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/10/02">Oct 2, 1950</a> - First strip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/10/04">Oct 4, 1950</a> - Snoopy appears.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/12/25">Dec 25, 1950</a> - First bemoaning
of loss of tradition to modern life. Not by Linus, he hadn't been introduced yet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/02/07">Feb 7, 1951</a> - Violet introduced.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/04/17">Apr 17, 1951</a> - First Woodstock-like behavior on the
part of a bird.  (The bird flew over Snoopy the previous day, so if this is Woodstock, Apr 16 would
have been his first appearance.)</i>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/05/30">May 30, 1951</a> - Schroeder is introduced, as a baby.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/09/24">Sep 24, 1951</a> - Charlie
Brown introduces Schroeder to the piano.</li>

frightened of real pianos.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/10/19">Oct 19, 1951</a> - Violet buys
a very small Christmas tree that kind of reminds me of later days.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/11/14">Nov 11, 1951</a> - Charlie Brown misses
the football for the first time.  Note that the holder is Violet (Lucy hadn't come
on the scene yet) and that she pulls the ball not because Chuck is a loser, but because
she's afraid he'll kick her hand.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/11/26">Nov 26, 1951</a> - Charlie Brown orders
a Beethoven bust for Schroder's piano.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/03/03">Mar 3, 1952</a> - Lucy introduced.
Really a manipulative little jerk right from the get-go.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/04/04">Apr 4, 1952</a> - Snoopy first
gets the idea of walking on two legs; it comes to him in a dream.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/05/27">May 27, 1952</a> - Snoopy first thinks in words.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/10/19">Oct 19, 1952</a> - First Snoopy dance.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/11/02">Nov 2, 1952</a> - Lucy "gets the best" of Charlie Brown for the first time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/11/16">Nov 16, 1952</a> - Aaaand Lucy does the football thing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/12/03">Dec 3, 1952</a> - Wishy-washy.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1954/11/30">Nov 30, 1954</a> - Introduction of well-known character Charlotte Braun.
Yep, good ol' Charlotte Braun... Wait, what?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1956/04/19">Apr 19, 1956</a> - First appearance of the kite-eating tree.
(I think.  Certainly <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1956/06/17">Sunday, Jun 6, 1956</a> makes it look like it, though.)</i>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1958/11/23">Nov 23, 1958</a> - First mention of the cat next door.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1958/12/12">Dec 12, 1958</a> - Snoopy sleeps on top of his doghouse for the first time.
Up until now he'd either slept with his head pillowed on a rock, or with it in his water bowl.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1959/08/23">Aug 23, 1959</a> - Sally actually appears.  She's <i>so cute</i>.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1965/03/14">Mar 14, 1965</a> - First actual use of the phrase "kite-eating tree".</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1966/08/22">Aug 22, 1966</a> - "Peppermint" Patty at last!</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1968/07/31">Jul 31, 1968</a> - Franklin! This storyline is a little trippy;
it's at the beach instead of at home, and he's kind of playing with the medium a little. When Franklin says
his dad is over in Vietnam, Chuck tells him his own dad was in a war, too, but he doesn't know which one.
That's because in 1968, Charlie Brown has been six years old for 18 years. His dad fought in WWII.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1969/11/30">Nov 30, 1969</a> - It was a dark and stormy night.
Suddenly, a shot rang out. A door slammed. The maid screamed. Suddenly, a pirate ship appeared on the horizon.
<br/>While millions of people were starving, the king lived in luxury. Meanwhile, on a small farm in Kansas,
a boy was growing up.<br/>End of Part I<br/>Part II<br/>A light snow was falling, and the little
girl with the tattered shawl had not sold a violet all day. At that very moment, a young intern
at City Hospital was making an important discovery.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1970/04/05">Apr 5, 1970</a> - The mysterious patient in room 213
had finally awakened. She moaned softly.
Could it be that she was the sister of the boy in Kansas who loved the girl
with the tattered shawl who was the daughter of the maid who had escaped from the
pirates? The intern frowned.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1970/06/22">Jun 22, 1970</a> - Woodstock finally gets a name.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1971/04/11">Apr 11, 1971</a> - The Easter Beagle? (First use of that epithet.)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1972/05/23">May 23, 1972</a> - Rerun!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1972/07/29">Jul 29, 1972</a> - The clouds got in my eyes.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1975/08/04">Aug 04, 1975</a> - Spike! Living in Needles already in 1975.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1975/11/01">Nov 01, 1975</a> - All I got was a rock.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1976/01/13">Jan 13, 1976</a> - Charlie Brown starts going to Peppermint Patty's
after his own commits suicide (they live in different parts of town).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1976/02/22">Feb 22, 1976</a> - First time Snoopy is the scout leader with Woodstock as the scout. (I think.)</li>
