This project will provide an open-source alternative to the 40-odd proprietary workflow systems available on the commercial
market.  Instead of laying down 50 large on an organizational tool, Joe Average will be able to use it to organize his
fishing trip.  You'll be able to use it to organize the publishing activities of a corporate website.  And the guys who were
thinking of laying down 50 large will think again.</font>

   As I figure out more of the industry, I'll start filling in a workflow topic.  I'll link to it when I start that page.

  Now this is just plain cool.  wftk is an open-source project funded by 
  <a href=/linkout/www.galacticmarketing.com>Galactic Marketing</a> through 
  <a href=/linkout/www.sourcexchange.com>SourceXchange</a>.
  SourceXchange is a new organization devoted to kicking off open-source projects by finding corporate sponsors.  So far,
  speaking for myself, it seems to be working.  Actually, as of 17 Jan 2000, there is one complete project and four
  active ones including this one, so it really <i>is</i> working.  It's an exciting concept.  Go look.
  <p>
  (1/17/00) As for wftk itself, the project will provide a workflow engine and at least one client for defining process classes.
  Planned platform will be C (maybe Perl) for the server, running via adapter as any one of a number of component types
  under AOLserver or IIS.  Initial coding will be for CGI and maybe an ActiveX object.  I'll see about that last.
  XML will be used for definition
  of process classes and for storage of process values for active processes.  The DTD for process classes is one of the
  early deliverables for the project, and I've already got some good plans but I'm concentrating on the usage scenarios
  first.
  The database will be configurable via adapter;
  initial code will include PostgreSQL and MS SQLServer.  Document management will be configurable via adapter;
  initial coding will include the Unix and NT filesystems and FileNet Panagon.
  <p>
  This is an ambitious project.  Yeah, I'm getting paid.  But your support and encouragement will go a long way towards
  helping me get through this.  This will be a sweet solution for a vast number of applications.  Join in!

</td><td>
  (1/17/00) This is the currently active phase of the project.  At this point, I'm just trying to define what it is we're actually
  doing.  The usage scenarios should be of great help.  Each one consists of a brief description of the process being
  modelled, an attempt at a RAD (Role-Action Diagram) and/or PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) chart, and then
  some musings about what variables might be defined for the process, what deliverables result from each task to be included
  in the final package, and so forth.  It's all pretty raw.  I'd appreciate comments.  Usage scenarios done or planned:<ul>
  <li>Purchase of a chair by corporate peon, ahem, pe<i>rs</i>on.  Excuse me.
  <li>Organization of a trade show.
  <li>Open-source software project management.
  <li>Closed-source software project management.
  <li>E-commerce order placement.
  <li>The SourceXchange process.
  </ul>
  Each of these usage scenarios will be modelled as a business process in the next phase of this project.
