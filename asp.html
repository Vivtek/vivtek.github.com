<div class="title">ASP (Active Server Pages)</div>

<center><table><tr><td>
<tr><td>
Active Server Pages (ASP) is Microsoft's core technology for active Web server content.  It's
a scripting engine which runs under IIS.  Here are its interesting features:
<ul>
<b><li>Windows-specific technology</b><br>ASP was made as an active content engine for IIS and
as such Microsoft built it for NT.  On the other hand, for IIS it's the default (non-CGI)
method of providing active content.
<b><li>Nice code embedding syntax</b><br>One of the returning irritants with active code is
how to integrate the code and the HTML which presents the results of the code.  With ASPs, both
code and layout are in the same file, which I don't like, but at least the <i>way</i> they're
in the same file is easy to work with.
<b><li>ASP scripting "optimized for" Windows-style object orientation</b><br>
Just can't help falling into Microspeak when I think ASP.  ASP, like all Microsoft's recent
technologies, is ActiveX-object-oriented.  If you have ActiveX objects, it's really easy to use
ASPs to integrate them with Web applications.
<b><li>Good session model</b><br>
The ASP <code>Session</code> object provides a really convenient cookie-based session tracking.
</ul>
Now on to some other thoughts and a little intro to how to write an ASP.
<p><i>Other platforms</i><br>By the way, if you decide you want
Unix after all but you've already developed a pile of ASPs, no big deal.  Microsoft won't help
you, of course, but a bunch called ChiliSoft can, with ChiliASP.
And the "Personal Web Server" (PWS) can also run ASPs and will run under Win95 or Win98.  Since
I run Win95 on my own development box and Win98 on my laptop, I like to have PWS there to test
ASPs when I actually have to write some.  So in all the following, when I say "IIS", read
"IIS or PWS or some weird ChiliASP-running Unix box or something."
<p>
The typical ASP scenario, of course, is that you've got IIS on an NT box already, perhaps for
political reasons, and you have to get some sort of active application on there.  ASP makes it
pretty easy.  It provides an embedding syntax and a scripting language.  VBScript is the default
scripting language, and even though Javascript (or even Perl, I understand) can be used as the
scripting language for an ASP, nearly everybody uses VBScript.
<p>
<i>That scripting concept</i><br>
In fact, since it's a <i>scripting</i> language, most IIS-only programmers refer to <i>any</i>
Web programming as "scripting."  Microsoft seems to encourage this viewpoint in their
documentation.  If you want my usual conspiracy-theory view, they want you to believe that
scripting is used as the glue, while you "drop down" into a serious -- and more expensive --
language to do serious work.
<p>
And in fact VBScript was designed with limitations in mind, from the number of variables you
may declare, to the total data size of a script.  So conspiracy theory or not, you can only
do so much in VBScript.
<p>
<i>How to write your own ASP</i><br>
I'm off track again.  What I wanted to do with this topic is to present a kind of "how to get
started" with an ASP from scratch.  Document the basic mechanisms and go from there.  Well, first
you have to realize that the file extension tells IIS (or PWS) what to do with each file called.
ASPs have a (default) extension of .asp, which makes a lot of sense.  All that extension tells
IIS is to run the page through the scripting engine.  If you don't do any scripting, the contents
of the file are spit out verbatim.  So key number one:
<blockquote>
An ASP is just HTML with some extra stuff.
</blockquote>
OK, so how do we get the server to run some stuff, then?  Well, just as you can use a
&lt;script&gt; tag to get the browser to run some code, you can use the <i>same</i> tag to tell
the server to run code, if you mark it with <code>runat="server"</code>.  Personally I find
this rather confusing, as it's difficult to see at a glance whether the script should run on the
server or on the client.
<p>
For that reason, instead of that tag syntax, I use the shorthand server-scripting syntax instead.
If you enclose any text within &lt;% ... %&gt;, then the enclosed text is considered a
server-side script.  That's much cooler-looking anyway.
<p>
The simplest thing to do with a server-side tag is just to write the value of some variable or
function call.  And one of the simplest function calls is to read something out of the query
URL: this can be done with Request("name of query").  For instance, I have a query of the form
my.asp?myquery=hi+there -- if my.asp contains this code:
<blockquote><code>
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;%=Request("myquery")%&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
</code></blockquote>
then it will appear like this:
<blockquote>
  <b>hi there</b>
</blockquote>
<i>VBScript</i><br>
The next logical thing to write about would be VBScript and its object model,
but I'm not going to do that.  VBScript is a neat little language,
and it's salient to more than just web programming, so it will (eventually, of course) get its
own topic.  When and if I have time to write up a topic on it, I'll link it here.
<p>
<i>Applications and global.asa</i><br>
Instead, I'm going to talk very shortly about the concept of an <i>application</i> in the
WinWeb world.  An application is effectively a group of ASP files which are grouped together
in a directory.  But where it gets interesting is that IIS also keeps track of whether anybody
has hit a page in that directory or not since the server started up (<i>insert tirade about how
much more often this is under NT than under Unix, heh</i>).  And if you use a
<code>Session</code> object, it will also track whether a session is starting up or not.
<p>
So what?  Well, if you include a file in your application directory called
<code>global.asa</code>, then IIS will use that file to create objects (use the &lt;object&gt;
tag with <code>runat=server</code>) or create any of four functions:
<code>Application_OnStart</code>, <code>Application_OnStop</code>,
<code>Session_OnStart</code>, <code>Session_OnStop</code>.  Anything else and IIS will complain.
At least, the underscored nomenclature is used if you're doing VBScript.  I assume Javascript would want dots.  Anyway, the <code>_OnStart</code> functions are useful for
creating and initializing objects.  (If the object can handle its own initialization then just
use the &lt;object&gt; tag.)  The <code>Session_OnStart</code> can initialize anything connected
with the user session.
<p>
<i>Onwards</i><br>
There are some other points I want to cover here eventually, such as
the whole object-oriented WinWeb philosophy, which I find rather interesting.  So stay tuned
and, as always, ask questions if you want to see some action.

Links will be coming whenever I have time to look some good ones up; for Windows programming
I don't usually use online resources that often.  This has two main reasons: first, I have lots
of offline resources instead, and second, I just have never seen much in the way of decent
documentation for WinWeb work.  But before I get on that soapbox, I'm going to get back to the
paying work.
