a stable online network, relationships with lots of banks, a willingness to forge new relationships
where necessary, and best of all, they don't charge an exorbitant chunk of your profit.

We can help you with CyberCash, or we can help you help yourself, in the following ways:

<p>
In short, you name it, we're ready to jump in and help, even if you're using somebody else's software.
Really.  And we'll <a href=/answers.html>answer questions for free</a>,
so don't hesitate to ask away.
<p>
<strong>MCK?  What's that?</strong><br>
The term "CyberCash" is often used inaccurately to refer to CyberCash's out-of-box connection
software, the Merchant Connectivity Kit (MCK).  The MCK is a set of CGI scripts that may be
integrated with a merchant's storefront in order to provide connectivity to CyberCash's online
transaction server network.  However, any software may be used to provide that connectivity as
long as it talks to the network correctly.  We at Vivtek, for instance, have implemented an
interface in Tcl for AOLserver (one of our <a href=/freebies.html>free downloads</a>.)  If you're interested in
rolling your own AOLserver solution and want to use our CyberCash integration, <a href=/aolserver/cybercash.html>just
click here to find out more.</a>
<p>
The MCK doesn't include shopping-cart functionality, and requires the availability of SSL on your
server to encrypt the communication between customer and your server (the MCK <i>will</i> handle
the encryption between your server and CyberCash, which is an extremely high-level encryption).
So you may well be interested in investigating our <a href=/ecomm.html>electronic commerce
solution for small business</a>, which takes all that stuff and puts it on our server, where we
can administer it easily and you don't have to, and gives you a wide range of services
that will help you and your customers have a more effective relationship.  We think this is a
pretty good option, so please take a look if you're interested in integrating online commerce
with your site.
<p>
Now that you've sat through the sales pitch, if you want to integrate CyberCash on your own,
feel perfectly free to do so.
Over the coming weeks, we're going to be including a lot more information about the technical
details of CyberCash integration here, so bookmark the page.  If you have any specific
questions that don't seem to be covered here, <a href=/answers.html>visit our answers page
to ask us</a> and we'll try to improve our presentation.
<p><strong>MDPs and how to find help</strong><br>
CyberCash has a network of Merchant Development Partners (MDPs), consulting organizations who can
assist merchants with the technical issues of integrating CyberCash online transaction processing
with their Websites.  Vivtek is an MDP, and if you need help with <i>your</i> CyberCash integration,
then <a href=mailto:sales@vivtek.com?subject=MDP%20inquiry>feel free to contact us at any time</a>.
We'll be happy to help out, even if it's just to answer your questions.  You can also find plenty
of other MDPs at the <a href=/linkout/www.cybercash.com>CyberCash website</a>

<table border=0><tr><td>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href=/cybercash/info.html>Information for the Internet merchant</a></strong><br>
This is an incredibly useful explanation of the whole online payment thing.  Read this if you have
any questions at all!  We've found this page extremely useful.
<li><strong><a href=/cybercash/anatomy.html>Anatomy of a CyberCash transaction</a></strong><br>
This is a kind of cute Shockwave cartoon about the steps that a transaction goes through.  It's
a nice switch from the dense text version of the explanation.
<li><strong><a href=/aolserver/cybercash.html>Our experiences integrating CyberCash with AOLserver</a></strong><br>
Even if you don't use AOLserver, you might want to check this out for some more perspective on the
technical end of the CyberCash service.
<li><strong><a href=/cybercash/popcodes.html>POP codes returned from CyberCash</a></strong><br>
The first in a series of pages about how to integrate your site with 
CyberCash.  The POP code returns are what you get back after a CC transaction.

<center><font face=arial size=+1>FEATURES</font></center></td></tr>

<tr><td>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free.</strong>  CyberCash doesn't cost anything to the merchant in most cases, because the
financial institution pays CyberCash for the service.  Your bank will charge you for credit
card transactions, but they do that anyway for phone transactions, so you're not losing anything.
<li><strong>Good merchant support.</strong>  Although they can deal slowly with non-emergency
cases, CyberCash never fails to respond to a question in a helpful manner.
<li><strong>Easy to integrate.</strong>  CyberCash has really gone the extra mile to deliver
an out-of-box package that is easy to integrate with an existing website.  And while technical
documentation of the MCK is thin, at least their example code is fairly easy to read.

<li><strong><a href=/linkout/www.cybercash.com>CyberCash home page</a></strong><br>
Everything you ever wanted to know about CyberCash can be found here, although not always where
you would expect to find it, which is one reason we're putting together this topic.
<li><strong><a href=/ecomm.html>Vivtek's ecomm service</a></strong><br>
We don't usually blow our own horn in these links, but this is one case where we'll make an
exception.  We really think that our solution is good, and our pricing is very low.  And it's
so much easier to administer than the MCK that we think it deserves looking at.  So, sorry.
We're linking to it anyway.
