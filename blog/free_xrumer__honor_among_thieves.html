<div class="title">Free XRUMER?  Honor among thieves</div>
<div class="st2">(unresolved tag blogline)</div>
<hr>
In the predictability department, one of my forum spam traps just pulled in
an interesting post: yeah, it was posted (presumably) by XRumer and certainly
fits the profile -- but it's advertising a crack of XRumer.
</p><p>
Heh.
</p><p>
"Greate new XRumer4.0 platinum edition and crack DOWNLAUD".
</p><p>
I wondered how long <i>that</i> cash cow would last -- looks like about, what,
November to April?  Actually, it took longer than I expected.
</p><p>
In case you're wondering whether this is a good idea, well, given that you
therefore think spamming is a valid business technique, then: sure, go ahead.
Download a crack from Russians and <i>give</i> them control of your machine.
</p><p>
In related news, I have doubled the number of forum sites I am despamming.
(If you're paying attention, that means, yes, I now have one that isn't my
own site.)  And I decided to try a notion that's really paid off in spades.
</p><p>
See, XRumer uses a vast database of known HTTP relays to post spam.  This
makes it much more difficult for human admins to block by IP -- since a single
spammer may have hundreds of IPs available, how can you block?
</p><p>
Well -- unintended consequence time!  Thanks to the explosion in use of these
proxies, we now have a reliable way to find them out without human intervention
at all.  Count the number of times Google indexes an IP, and you have an
<i>incredibly</i> effective way to determine whether it is on the list of known
proxies used by spammers.  Granted, you have the lag between the time it
becomes a proxy and when Google starts indexing the references to it on forum
posts around the world.  But this one test for spam blocks about 60% or more
of forum spam, sight unseen.
</p><p>
It won't last.  But then again, neither will XRumer, not in its present form.
</p><p>
Just to help you out, I've provided a simple Google hit counter:
<a href="http://www.vivtek.com/google_count">go here and type in any phrase</a>, not just
an IP address, to see how many references to the phrase Google has indexed.
When I've got a little more timeframe behind it, I'll even put in autorepeating
queries of the good ones, with gnuplot graphs to show googlecount over time.
</p><p>
And of course, I'll be putting the code up; it's about ten lines of Perl --
the only reason it's that long is that it caches results in a database so
repeated queries don't pound Google.  Not that Google can't stand the pounding,
but I don't really want a bunch of Perl script threads hanging around waiting
on Net latency.
</p><p>
So, a common refrain lately: more later.
</p><p>
