<div class="title">Third article in as many weeks</div>
<div class="st2">2014-04-24 <a href="keyword_writing.html">writing</a></div>
<hr>
So I just finished <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::KeePassRest">WWW::KeePassRest</a> and wrote a little
<a href="/perl/keepassrest.html">article about how I did that</a>, and now, flush with victory, I'm casting around a little
to see what else I can write about.
</p><p>
There's a lot.
</p><p>
First up will probably be the second installment on the TRADOS language saga; with
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32::RunAsAdmin">Win32::RunAsAdmin</a> I now have the crucial tool I was missing to
wrap the prototype code up into a module suitable for framing. That gives me a decent little utility I
can call from the command line - easier to remember than looking for a script, that's for sure!
</p><p>
But after that... I'm not sure. I've done some work getting IE::Mechanize ready for new generations of Internet
Explorer, but until I'm actually <i>done</i> with that effort, I don't think I want to write about it.
Although my tools for doing so are getting better.
</p><p>
Similarly, the work I've done with Exegete (my tool for writing about code) has only begun to scratch the
surface. It'll turn into good writing as well as a good writing tool soon enough.
</p><p>
There are three <i>big</i> topics I want to address, but they're all pretty daunting. They're going to
be article series instead of single articles. The first is Win32::OLE, specifically documentation of the XS
code and the APIs it exposes without actually documenting them anywhere. That's been a problem for me for
some time, and I'm not the only one.
</p><p>
Kind of tangent to this would be a module generator for COM interface modules; 
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32::Shortcut">Win32::Shortcut</a> would be a good starting point for that kind of
very simple wrapper. Since this would be a decent supplement for better understanding of OLE in the first place,
and since I halfway suspect it's going to end up being my only actual option for automating IE, this is
actually a pretty decent early target.
</p><p>
Where exegesis is going to really get serious is GPG. Thomas Ptacek proposed some kind of code-level documentation
a few months ago and I've really been working towards building the tools and the skills to write that kind
of text. That will be useful for a wider audience, too, so from a point of view of mindshare it will be
an excellent target.
</p><p>
Finally, there's always OpenLogos, the machine translation tool I adopted (and have neglected) a couple of years
ago. It's massively huge and atrociously (that is: not) documented, so again, it's something for which the
whole concept of a code exegesis will pay off.
</p><p>
So there's no shortage of grist for the mill. It's just a question of picking closer targets first.
I suspect the order I've presented these systems in will be roughly the order I start writing about them.
</p><p>
Oh, I suppose an article about the refactoring approach I've been taking to these little CPAN modules
might not be a bad idea.
