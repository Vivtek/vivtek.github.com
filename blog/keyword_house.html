Remember how BoingBoing had that post a little while back about how the housing market in Detroit and Indianapolis had collapsed to the point where you could get a nice little house for a few thousand dollars?
</p><p>
Well, I had already been looking at the Indiana market when that post was posted, and after letting two possibles slip through my fingers, on Thursday I found the right one, in Richmond, Indiana.  Here's the picture I got from Mr. Google:
</p><p>
<image src="/images/house.jpg">
</p><p>
It's brick, which is good for people like us who do irresponsible things like going to Europe for a summer (we lost a house to mold that way once, I kid you not -- Indiana summers are not to be trifled with).  It was built in 1890, meaning it's survived a lot already.  It has a new roof.  It has the original built-in cabinetry, something I've always really liked in nineteenth-century small-town Indiana homes.
</p><p>
It's got four bedrooms, two full baths, and what the tax records describe as two formal dining rooms.  A total of 12 finished rooms, about 2.5 times the space we're in now.  Oh, and a 20x40-foot "storage shed" in back, built in 1920, something I'm assuming will turn out to be a barn.
</p><p>
The seller accepted my offer today.
</p><p>
<b>$8000</b>.  Right.  That's eight thousand dollars, for a perfectly good house with a new(ish) roof.  My previous best bet (which I waffled too long to get) sold for $10,000, also a brick house of about that vintage.  This one's better.
</p><p>
I'm currently enjoying the silver lining of this whole economy thing, but ... this is a little scary.
</p><p>
<i>Update, 2009-03-10</i>: oh dear Lord, I just thought to look at the aerial photography from Microsoft (Google street view didn't go down C Avenue to the house's south).  It is a freaking battleship of a house.  I really <i>am</i> going to heat it with steam and install a lightning tower.
</p><p>
<img src="/images/house1.jpg"><img src="/images/house2.jpg">
</p><p>
Note the "storage shed" in the back.  It's 20x40, has a garage door on the south, and appears to me to be a two-story barn.  Good God almighty, what have I just <i>bought</i>?

The plot thickens.  It turns out that the edifice in question was until some point in time no earlier than August, 2007 an "intentional community ... balanc[ing] work, ministry, and restoration."  Here is a picture of a man with an alligator behind or to the side of the house:
</p><p>
<img src="/images/alligator.jpg">
</p><p>
Fascinating, the notion of buying a house with history attached.
</p><p>
The house was mentioned in <i>Quaker Life</i>'s <a href="http://www.fum.org/QL/issues/0309/index.htm">September, 2003 issue</a>.  "Renaissance House: A Ministry of Renovation".  It is still linked to from <a href="http://www.richmondquakers.com/">richmondquakers.com</a>, but the renaissancehouse.org domain is gone to the Bitbucket in the Sky, and no, the Wayback Machine only caches an older owner of the domain, not the 2005-2007-vintage site, which is a shame.  Pictures would have been nice.
</p><p>
<i>Update 2009-03-18</i>: The alligator's name is Amos Moses, and the man himself is John Fitch, the director of Renaissance House and former owner of the edifice in question.  It turns out he's a pretty nice guy (well, you expect that of Quakers) and the Renaissance House community is still going strong in two nearby houses with much lower payments.
</p><p>
So <i>that's</i> good.

<div class="st2">2009-03-24 <a href="keyword_economics.html">economics</a> <a href="keyword_house.html">house</a></div><br>
Tomorrow, March 25, I'm closing on the house.  The title company has the money, my sister has my power of attorney, and all is set; tomorrow I become a landowner again.  But there's something I don't understand, now that I've seen the HUD document detailing the financing of this deal.
</p><p>
John Fitch bought this house to form the Renaissance House in 2003, financing $54,000. I very much doubt he'd paid more than he had to. So five years later, I can't imagine he owed less than $50,000 or so. Following me?
</p><p>
Of the $8000 changing hands tomorrow, $2500 goes to the realtor, $700 to a property management company (coincidentally also the realtor, but that's not the point), $500 to a listing placement company, etc. etc. The actual current holder of the mortgage will be getting a tad over $4000 for this magnificent structure.
</p><p>
So here's my question. Given that this is more than a 90% loss -- why? Why would they foreclose? Is this one of those "pennies on the dollar mortgage purchases" one reads about? Who benefits?
</p><p>
Because somebody thought this was a good idea. The realtor clearly thinks so, with reason. I think so, because I get a cheap house (actually, Renaissance House may end up getting the use of the building for a year or two; we'll see). But the original holder of the mortgage?
</p><p>
Somebody's really insane in all this.  And it seems indicative of the whole economy.

<div class="st2">2009-03-27 <a href="keyword_house.html">house</a></div><br>
So we own the house now!  My sister immediately went there and took an inordinate number of pictures, which you can find at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49961499@N00/sets/72157615939098722/">Flickr</a>, of course.  It's a great house!
</p><p>
So I also <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/117855/Old-house-bought-check-Now-what">asked MetaFilter</a> what they could add.  And (as they do) they came up with a very large amount of food for thought and useful links.
</p><p>
Current ETA on-site for triage and cleaning is mid-May.

Subject: Can anyone edit your blog?
</p><p>
I hope not. But just in case we can I'd just like to say (and I speak for all of
 humanity here) that you should let us people on the internet come and live in y
our carriage house whenever we feel like it. We wouldn't pay you per se. But thi
nk of it as wiki-living.
</p><p>
thank you,
-tom
</p>

</p><p>
Tom, I can't tell you how horrifying an idea I find that, but the sad fact of the matter is that my family and I are living in the carriage house
at the moment, before getting underway renovating the big house.
</p><p>
However, finding tom's post in the spam filter (sorry, tom, nothing personal) reminds me that I kind of left my home-grown blog high and dry in favor
of the shiny new House-specific <a href="http://big-old-house.blogspot.com">Blogspot blog</a> I started shortly after arrival here in town.  Check it out; lots of status updates
and pictures.
