The plot thickens.  It turns out that the edifice in question was until some point in time no earlier than August, 2007 an "intentional community ... balanc[ing] work, ministry, and restoration."  Here is a picture of a man with an alligator behind or to the side of the house:
</p><p>

</p><p>
Fascinating, the notion of buying a house with history attached.
</p><p>
The house was mentioned in <i>Quaker Life</i>'s <a href="http://www.fum.org/QL/issues/0309/index.htm">September, 2003 issue</a>.  "Renaissance House: A Ministry of Renovation".  It is still linked to from <a href="http://www.richmondquakers.com/">richmondquakers.com</a>, but the renaissancehouse.org domain is gone to the Bitbucket in the Sky, and no, the Wayback Machine only caches an older owner of the domain, not the 2005-2007-vintage site, which is a shame.  Pictures would have been nice.
</p><p>
<i>Update 2009-03-18</i>: The alligator's name is Amos Moses, and the man himself is John Fitch, the director of Renaissance House and former owner of the edifice in question.  It turns out he's a pretty nice guy (well, you expect that of Quakers) and the Renaissance House community is still going strong in two nearby houses with much lower payments.
</p><p>
So <i>that's</i> good.

<div class="st2">2009-03-24 <a href="keyword_economics.html">economics</a> <a href="keyword_house.html">house</a></div><br>
Tomorrow, March 25, I'm closing on the house.  The title company has the money, my sister has my power of attorney, and all is set; tomorrow I become a landowner again.  But there's something I don't understand, now that I've seen the HUD document detailing the financing of this deal.
</p><p>
John Fitch bought this house to form the Renaissance House in 2003, financing $54,000. I very much doubt he'd paid more than he had to. So five years later, I can't imagine he owed less than $50,000 or so. Following me?
</p><p>
Of the $8000 changing hands tomorrow, $2500 goes to the realtor, $700 to a property management company (coincidentally also the realtor, but that's not the point), $500 to a listing placement company, etc. etc. The actual current holder of the mortgage will be getting a tad over $4000 for this magnificent structure.
</p><p>
So here's my question. Given that this is more than a 90% loss -- why? Why would they foreclose? Is this one of those "pennies on the dollar mortgage purchases" one reads about? Who benefits?
</p><p>
Because somebody thought this was a good idea. The realtor clearly thinks so, with reason. I think so, because I get a cheap house (actually, Renaissance House may end up getting the use of the building for a year or two; we'll see). But the original holder of the mortgage?
</p><p>
Somebody's really insane in all this.  And it seems indicative of the whole economy.

So I got this spam today: Lower house Payments 30%. And I realized: 70% of zero is still zero.

How cool is that?
