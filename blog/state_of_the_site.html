<hr>
Between 2009 and 2014, a lot happened to me, but none of it shows
in this blog. Mostly that's because I wanted to blog the house
renovation and my blogging code of the day was a horrendous, unmaintainable
mess that never seemed to do anything I wanted - so I switched to Blogger.
(You can see the house blog <a href="http://big-old-house.blogspot.com/">here</a>, but
as we left the country again two years ago and unloaded the house last
summer, it's gotten kinda boring.
</p><p>
In November of that year, I started thinking harder about what programming
actually means. And that turned into the
<a href="http://semantic-programming.blogspot.com/">semantic programming blog</a>, also
at Blogger. Over the next two years, that effort resulted in a kind of neat
declarative programming system for Perl, which collapsed under its own
technical debt shortly thereafter.
</p><p>
I had family stress for the year after that, culminating in our
leaving the country for Budapest in 2012 after our daughter graduated high
school. The summer after <i>that</i> we sold the house and I discovered
that my blood pressure could best be measured in psi. And now things
with family, health, and finances are actually pretty good, and my thoughts
wander back to writing.
</p><p>
The Blogger system is great for short-to-medium text and pictures that
can be written quickly and don't need any internal structure. It was a fantastic
medium for the house blog. It is
<i>not</i> fantastic for code given its rigid three-column format, difficulty
comprehending monospace fonts, and refusal to handle indentation, and
is also less than great for any presentation longer than a few paragraphs.
So to write real technical articles, I needed to revitalize the Vivtek site.
</p><p>
Back in the day, the site was hosted on AOLserver for historical reasons, and
elements like the sidebar menu and a lot of the other bits and pieces were
handled dynamically. The content was compiled on the server. But as that
system aged and the box was put to additional uses, the cracks in its structure
became apparent. Anything exposed to Internet input becomes an instantaneous
spam archive, MediaWiki in a different site I was hosting there was a relentless
processor hog, the Despammed spam filter made sure that if there was any
resource problem it would be magnified tenfold as the queue backed up behind
the kink, and the accreted weirdness of twelve years of haphazard Perl scripts
running behind the scenes had forced me to move the site's static content
to Github hosting. The dynamic content was left to hang in the weather. I had
more important fish to fry.
</p><p>
So to get the site back into working shape, I had to reinvent my content
handling code on my laptop and integrate with the static site. And there simply
hasn't been enough time to think about that - especially given my penchant,
when given <i>any</i> programming task, to think about how it <i>should</i>
be possible to code it at a higher semantic level. I can talk to myself at length
about just finishing this damn script today and worrying about entire new
programming paradigms at some later date, but it doesn't help.
</p><p>
But at the end of last month, after working two month's worth of jobs in March,
I decided that what I needed in the first week of April was a sabbatical.
I wanted to write at least one article. (Actually I have a whole page of one-line
ideas of things to do this week. And instead, it's Saturday night, day 9 of
the sabbatical, work already queued up for Monday, and I haven't even written the
article yet - but I did do the research for it, and wrote a kick-ass tool for
my daily work, and that's really the point of this week.)
</p><p>
And lo! I have the site compiling again - and with a tool I'm not even ashamed of!
One that will hopefully soon grow into a more mature writing environment in the
future, including a notion I've been calling "code exegesis", about which more
later.  Hopefully, now that the site builder works well, I can keep things moving
with less than a full week off work, and build up some momentum. I have a lot
of things I want to write about, so that's not a problem. Historically, family
and financial stress have been my greatest impetus sinks, and those (knock on
wood) are at low ebb currently, may they stay that way forever.
</p><p>
And that's why the blog below goes from 2014 to 2009
with no visible transition. I am cautiously hopeful that things will start
moving again now.
