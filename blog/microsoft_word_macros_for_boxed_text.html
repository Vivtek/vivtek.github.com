<hr>
One of the neat little things I did over the past few days was a
simple Word macro -- at least, it <i>should</i> have been simple, but
the problem is one I've had for a long time.
</p><p>
In this case, what I wanted to do was to fix up a few documents I had from
a translation customer.  This particular end user, for reasons known only
to them, captions their figures using fields.  The fields are in text boxes
for easy positioning, and the field results (the text you see on the screen)
are the captions.
</p><p>
Only one problem: the fields are always variable results for <i>variables
which don't exist in the document</i>.  All I can figure is that the
document preparer makes these things in little snippets with some other tool
which spits out Word texts, then they paste those into the text boxes.
</p><p>
So, you're asking now (unless you're a professional translator) who cares?
You just type your English over the German in the captions, and you're
home free, right?  Well: no.  Everybody who's anybody in the wonderful
world of translation nowadays uses translation tools, in this case TRADOS.
</p><p>
TRADOS does two things for you: it stores each and every sentence you translate
in a <i>translation memory</i> (a TM), so you (sort of) never need to 
translate anything twice, and it also makes it much easier to step through
a document translating.  The use of TRADOS makes translation <i>much</i>
easier, and it also helps you stay consistent in your use of words and
phrases.
</p><p>
Herein lies the problem: those fields were untouchable by TRADOS.  There are
two modes in TRADOS: one steps through the document using Word macros
but doesn't deal well
with text boxes (and yes, you'll note they're in
text boxes).  So that approach was out.
The other (the TagEditor) converts the entire document to an
XML format, then edits that in a very convenient way.  The TagEditor makes
short work of text boxes, but those field results were invisible to it.
</p><p>
Stuck!  And so for a series of three jobs from that customer, I just didn't
use TRADOS on the figure attachments, and hated it.  Last week, though, I
took screwdriver in hand (metaphorically speaking) and decided it was
showdown time.
</p><p>
OK, that's the teaser -- follow the link to get the ... <i>rest</i> of the
story.
So as it turns out, the reason TRADOS Word macros don't deal well with text
boxes is -- to put it gently -- Microsoft Word's handling of text boxes is
stupid.
</p><p>
The main document text you see before you turns out to be only one of
an arbitrary number of <i>stories</i> in the document.  And yes, each text
box is itself a story.  So any macro which wants to look at all the text
in a document must walk through all the stories.  Word's own word counter
won't do that, by the way.  If your text is in text boxes, Word won't count
it.  (Which is why most translators use some other tool to count words.)
</p><p>
Here is how Microsoft's documentation defines stories:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
 story
</p><p>
 A document area that contains a range of text distinct from other
 areas of text in a document. For example, if a document includes body
 text, footnotes, and headers, it contains a main text story, footnotes
 story, and headers story.
</p><p>
 There are 11 different types of stories that can be part of a
 document, corresponding to the following WdStoryType constants:
 wdCommentsStory, wdEndnotesStory, wdEvenPagesFooterStory,
 wdEvenPagesHeaderStory, wdFirstPageFooterStory,
 wdFirstPageHeaderStory, wdFootnotesStory, wdMainTextStory,
 wdPrimaryFooterStory, wdPrimaryHeaderStory, and wdTextFrameStory.
 The StoryRanges collection contains the first story for each story
 type available in a document. Use the NextStoryRange method to return
 subsequent stories.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
So all I have to do is to loop through the stories, find all the fields
in each, select each field, and replace it with its own contents.  Then I
can run TRADOS on the resulting document and translate my little heart out.
</p><p>
Only one problem (ha!): Word won't loop through the stories.  Word instead
will only loop through the <i>types</i> of story in the document, and you can
loop through the stories in each type after that.  Ugh!
</p><p>
Here's my code:
<pre>
   For Each sr In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges
      If sr.StoryType = wdTextFrameStory Then
         done = False
         While Not done
            ct = sr.Fields.Count
            For i = 1 To ct
               Set f = sr.Fields(1)
               t = f.Result.Text
               f.Select
               Selection.Text = t
            Next i
<br>
            Set sr = sr.NextStoryRange
            If sr Is Nothing Then done = True
         Wend
      End If
   Next sr
</pre>
</p><p>
Note a few things:
<ul>
<li>Always use "Set" when setting object references!  Otherwise (as I always
rediscover, since I use Visual Basic once every two years) VB will helpfully
dereference the object for you and convert it to a string.  Which, of course,
will be <i>useless</i>.
<li>The "sr" object is the story range.  That is simply the full text of
each story in the loop.  Note that for this particular task, I didn't want
to mess with headers, footers, etc., so I'm skipping anything that's not
a text box (a "text frame story" in OO parlance.)
<li>The payload starts at "ct = sr.Fields.Count".  That's where we look at
the fields in the text box.  For each one, we grab its result with "f.Result.Text", then select the field with "f.Select", then replace it.
<li>After each field is replaced, the next field is <i>still field number 1</i>
in the range!  That's why we can't do a For Each loop here.
<li>Note the double loop: we have a For Each sr around the top, then a 
While Not done with the test at the end.  The For Each iterates through the
story range types (by moving from the first of each type to the first of the
next type).  The "Set sr = sr.NextStoryRange" is responsible for finding
all the instances of a given story type while in that loop.
</ul>
</p><p>
And thus concludes my daily code posting.  Join us again tomorrow, kids!
