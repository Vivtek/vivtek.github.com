Remember how BoingBoing had that post a little while back about how the housing market in Detroit and Indianapolis had collapsed to the point where you could get a nice little house for a few thousand dollars?
</p><p>
Well, I had already been looking at the Indiana market when that post was posted, and after letting two possibles slip through my fingers, on Thursday I found the right one, in Richmond, Indiana.  Here's the picture I got from Mr. Google:
</p><p>
<image src="/images/house.jpg">
</p><p>
It's brick, which is good for people like us who do irresponsible things like going to Europe for a summer (we lost a house to mold that way once, I kid you not -- Indiana summers are not to be trifled with).  It was built in 1890, meaning it's survived a lot already.  It has a new roof.  It has the original built-in cabinetry, something I've always really liked in nineteenth-century small-town Indiana homes.
</p><p>
It's got four bedrooms, two full baths, and what the tax records describe as two formal dining rooms.  A total of 12 finished rooms, about 2.5 times the space we're in now.  Oh, and a 20x40-foot "storage shed" in back, built in 1920, something I'm assuming will turn out to be a barn.
</p><p>
The seller accepted my offer today.
</p><p>
<b>$8000</b>.  Right.  That's eight thousand dollars, for a perfectly good house with a new(ish) roof.  My previous best bet (which I waffled too long to get) sold for $10,000, also a brick house of about that vintage.  This one's better.
</p><p>
I'm currently enjoying the silver lining of this whole economy thing, but ... this is a little scary.
</p><p>
<i>Update, 2009-03-10</i>: oh dear Lord, I just thought to look at the aerial photography from Microsoft (Google street view didn't go down C Avenue to the house's south).  It is a freaking battleship of a house.  I really <i>am</i> going to heat it with steam and install a lightning tower.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Note the "storage shed" in the back.  It's 20x40, has a garage door on the south, and appears to me to be a two-story barn.  Good God almighty, what have I just <i>bought</i>?
</p><p>
