Did I mention that I'm not only going to be covering technical topics on this blog?  Today's word, kids, is "Aquaponics".
</p><p>
<i>Aquaculture</i> is growing fish for food.  <i>Hydroponics</i> is growing food (or other) plants in water or other non-soil rooting
medium.  <i>Aquaponics</i> is using the fish water as the hydroponic nutrient solution, which does two things for you: the plants filter
the nutrients (ammonia is fish urine but plant ambrosia) out of the water, so they don't choke the fish but instead are converted
into, say, lettuce; and the fish provide 
completely organic and relatively balanced set of nutrients for the plants.  So the combination is superior than either together, which
makes perfect sense if you consider that two smaller ecologies put together into one bigger one are necessarily more balanced and stable.
</p><p>
Anyway, that's our family's project this week.  We had already wanted to grow lettuce indoors for the winter, and so instead of
simply growing lettuce, we are growing lettuce <i>floating in a styrofoam block on an aquarium</i>.  The aquarium will have goldfish, so we
won't be eating that end of the system -- but it could just as well have tilapia in it.  In fact, tilapia are great aquaculture fish because
they'll essentially eat anything.  If they don't eat it, it just feeds algae, and they eat the algae instead.
</p><p>
So after we level up with 25 gallons of goldfish tank, I am very seriously considering building a much larger tank in the backyard under
a geodesic dome (per Organic Gardening of 1972) and growing me some serious tilapia.  Did you know that in a round pool 12 feet in diameter
and 3 feet deep (a small section of our backyard) you can harvest 500 half-pound tilapia every couple of months?  No, neither did I until today.
</p><p>
Anyway, I see all this as related to programming.  Both are simply the design of systems to meet needs.  And in fact, I find the way I think
about an aquaponics system is very similar to the way I think about a general data processing system.  Where an aquaponics system outputs
lettuce, a data processing system outputs some information I want.  To make lettuce, I need to consider the nutrients and water and light; to
make valuable information I need to consider the available raw data.
</p><p>
In either case, I find that a small, modular approach works well.  In the case of aquaculture, it's a matter of considering what nutrients
are where and what organisms can convert one thing to another; whereas in software, it's a matter of seeing simple data structures and designing
lightweight tools that can convert one to another -- and then you organize all your little modules/organisms into an ecology.
</p><p>
Lately, there have been two (software) projects I've worked
on in which this systems approach has worked well.  The new Toon-o-Matic is composed of a number of small, relatively simple Perl scripts which
are all organized by a Makefile.  Each script reads one or two or three input data structures, and emits one or two.  The overall network
could be drawn as a graph (and indeed, that would be edifying and entertaining, and I should do that.)
</p><p>
The other such system is this blog.  I've deliberately kept the approach simple and completely <i>sui generis</i>.  I'm reinventing the wheel
to a certain extent, but that's the attraction -- I like new wheels, and the occasional flaw doesn't bother me, as I always learn.  Evolution
doesn't mind reinventing the wheel -- did you know that the eye has evolved many completely separate times?  The eyes of insects, vertebrates, and
molluscs are three completely independent instances of the evolution of a visual sensor.  And the eyes of molluscs (like octopi) are demonstrably
superior to ours: our retinal nerves are in <i>front</i> of our retinae, thus each eye has a blind spot where the optic nerve penetrates the retina
to leave the eyeball.  Molluscs sensibly have their retinal nerves <i>behind</i> the retina: no blind spot.  Another reason to believe in Intelligent
Design -- just, you know, not of us.  God loves the octopus, which is why global warming is going to provide the octopus with lots of shallow,
warm seas with recently vacated cities in them.
</p><p>
Anyway, back on something resembling a track: my ultimate goal in the case of aquaculture is to close the ecological loop.  I want to take
my kitchen and garden waste, recycle it with
vermiculture and composting, feed the worms and plants to tilapia, use the fish water for lettuce and seedlings and the worm castings for root
vegetables, and ultimately I believe it may well be possible to feed my family fresh fish and veggies with not much more input than cardboad, grass
clippings, and leaves, and whatever's on sale at Kroger.
</p><p>
My goal in the case of most data processing systems is less lofty: I simply want to model some useful process in small, easily maintained and
easily modified steps, so that the system remains flexible and reliable.  But in either case, the thought processes are similar: to attain a large
goal, break it down into small, reusable task utilities.
</p><p>
I'll keep you posted on both.
