<div class="st2">2006-11-28 <a href="keyword_programming.html">programming</a> <a href="keyword_msword.html">msword</a> <a href="keyword_word-macro.html">word-macro</a> <a href="keyword_translation.html">translation</a></div><br>
One of the neat little things I did over the past few days was a
simple Word macro -- at least, it <i>should</i> have been simple, but
the problem is one I've had for a long time.
</p><p>
In this case, what I wanted to do was to fix up a few documents I had from
a translation customer.  This particular end user, for reasons known only
to them, captions their figures using fields.  The fields are in text boxes
for easy positioning, and the field results (the text you see on the screen)
are the captions.
</p><p>
Only one problem: the fields are always variable results for <i>variables
which don't exist in the document</i>.  All I can figure is that the
document preparer makes these things in little snippets with some other tool
which spits out Word texts, then they paste those into the text boxes.
</p><p>
So, you're asking now (unless you're a professional translator) who cares?
You just type your English over the German in the captions, and you're
home free, right?  Well: no.  Everybody who's anybody in the wonderful
world of translation nowadays uses translation tools, in this case TRADOS.
</p><p>
TRADOS does two things for you: it stores each and every sentence you translate
in a <i>translation memory</i> (a TM), so you (sort of) never need to 
translate anything twice, and it also makes it much easier to step through
a document translating.  The use of TRADOS makes translation <i>much</i>
easier, and it also helps you stay consistent in your use of words and
phrases.
</p><p>
Herein lies the problem: those fields were untouchable by TRADOS.  There are
two modes in TRADOS: one steps through the document using Word macros
but doesn't deal well
with text boxes (and yes, you'll note they're in
text boxes).  So that approach was out.
The other (the TagEditor) converts the entire document to an
XML format, then edits that in a very convenient way.  The TagEditor makes
short work of text boxes, but those field results were invisible to it.
</p><p>
Stuck!  And so for a series of three jobs from that customer, I just didn't
use TRADOS on the figure attachments, and hated it.  Last week, though, I
took screwdriver in hand (metaphorically speaking) and decided it was
showdown time.
</p><p>
OK, that's the teaser -- follow the link to get the ... <i>rest</i> of the
story.

So again, a lick and a promise for this blog as I madly try to finish some
translation work.  This translation job is an interesting one, though, as
I mentioned, and as it turns out, amenable to editing in a specialized
tool I just wrote today.  Of course, having <i>written</i> the tool today
means I have to <i>use</i> the tool this evening in a mad dash to finish,
which in turn means I have no time to <i>document</i> the code until
tomorrow at the very earliest.
</p><p>
Suffice it to say that the exercise was surprisingly easy.  The task was
simple: I need a tool to edit text files in which (for reasons we'll go into
later) I have a number of phrases, one per line.  The phrases mostly have
all the right words in them, but not in the right order.  I thus need a way
to <i>quickly</i> select one or more words and drag it into the right place
in the phrase.  Sure, you say, Word does that.  Yeah, except that Word
doesn't put the spaces in the right place.  God and Bill Gates alone know
why, but <i>Word doesn't put the fricking spaces in the right place</i> when
I drag words around on a line, and so I took matters into my own hands and
rolled my own solution.  And by God it works!  Still a few little oddities
in it, but it works more quickly than Word for this particular application.
</p><p>
Another nice thing it can do is this: when I drag the first word of a phrase
out into the middle, it can decapitalize that word, and capitalize the new
first word.  That saves me a fraction of a second, and multiplied by 2000
phrases that adds up to a lot of time.
</p><p>
And another little thing I just now added: I can hit a key and toggle the
case of the word the cursor is on.  Again: this may or may not be of general
use, but for this particular application it's very convenient.  And that's
really the idea of special-purpose text editors.  An example from the
programming world is emacs -- you can write LISP code to make emacs do
literally anything at all (including psychoanalysis) from your text editor.
The only problem being that it's too damn hard to start.  Python's easier,
at least for me.  So a text editor in which you can embed your own Python
snippets might be a generally useful tool indeed!
</p><p>
So.  Tomorrow or Sunday, documentation and maybe some more movement on the
drop tagger.  And in the meantime, go get some sleep!  (I know I won't any
time soon.)

<div class="st2">2006-12-08 <a href="keyword_translation.html">translation</a> <a href="keyword_machine-translation.html">machine-translation</a></div><br>
I just wanted to note at this juncture that my notion of running some very
simple machine-translation code (yes, lovingly hand-coded in Perl) on a
certain class of text, followed by human intervention using <i>just the
right kind of editor</i> seems to be bearing fruit.
</p><p>
Granted, I would be in much less deadline trouble right now if I'd just
done the Right Thing, shut up, and translated the text.  But the text in
question is not nicely flowing text.  It is PLC message output written
by engineers for machine operators, and it is <i>dense</i>.  Very, very
dense.  So if I'd just translated it by hand I would have screwed up over
and over.
</p><p>
Instead, I first scanned the entire text, broke it into words (with varying
success), and looked up each and every word I didn't know.  For those of you
who aren't translators, this doesn't just mean not knowing a word at all; it
includes not knowing what those particular engineers and machine operators
intend to say with a particular technical term.  This can be challenging, but
in this case I had a lot of previously translated text, so I could look most
words up in that.
</p><p>
Once all the words were "known" (ha), I ran the whole thing through a phrase
scanner.  Frequently occurring phrases were presented with word-by-word
translations, along with some crude rewrite rules to make a better guess.
This is all very, very naive, as any translator knows.  It's not even as good
as SYSTRAN, and SYSTRAN sucks.
</p><p>
But as I translated more of the frequent phrases, the system was able to
string together better guesses for the longer phrases.  At some point, then,
I decided to switch over to direct translation of the actual segment list.
This text was "nice" (in this one aspect alone) because segmentation was
easy -- every line is a separate sentence, so there's no need to figure out
where sentences might break.  That's convenient.
</p><p>
At any rate, I am now using my specialized text editor to approve and/or
modify each resulting phrase.  Remember: all the words are already there,
sort of, just not usually in an understandable order.  Now that I can <i>very
quickly</i> select and drag them around, though, <b>my new translating
technique is unstoppable</b>. Ha!  They said it couldn't be done!  <i>Those
fools!</i>  MWAahahahaha!
</p><p>
(coff)  OK, I'm better now.  Documentation soon.  I just felt enthusiastic.
