<div class="title">Perl and NLP</div>

<hr>
So I've long had a thing about doing NLP-type stuff in Perl.  I know, I know. All the cool kids
use NLTK in Python. So why Perl?
</p><p>
As always, the answer is CPAN. I can get a good, quick start in nearly anything by installing a CPAN
module, and I know it has been tested on Windows already thanks to CPANtesters. And anything <i>I</i>
write will be tested six ways from Sunday, too.
</p><p>
So Perl.
</p><p>
A few years ago I hacked out the beginnings of a tokenizer for NLP usage. It really just consisted of
a convenient iterator wrapper around some very simple regexes, along with some n-gram type stuff for
collocations (not that I've ever had much luck with those - yet). I've revived it and I've been
tossing some actual translation jobs at it to see what sticks, and it's nearly ready for release.
</p><p>
I had the revelation, though, that what even NLTK is missing in terms of <i>practical</i> use is
that it's a mess trying to retrieve information from documents. So my tokenizer explicitly works with
a source document, which can deliver a series of text and formatting commands in a pre-tokenization step.
The formatting commands are passed right through by the tokenizer.
</p><p>
Along the way, I realized that to do part-of-speech tagging I was going to need a lexicon. I've got a
dumb model of a lexicon running against SQLite (which will be good for job-specific vocabulary), but for
the main lexicon in German, it just isn't possible to get around the morphological structure of the
German language. So I'm currently adapting the <a href="http://www.j3e.de/ispell/igerman98/">igerman98 ispell dictionary</a>.
Its affix script is a pretty good run-down of German morphology, although it doesn't encode parts of
speech very accurately. (Nouns are capitalized, of course, and adjectives/adverbs are pretty much "A"-flagged
decliners.)
</p><p>
There's going to be a lot of tweaking involved, but the end result is going to be a pretty good
data-based lexicon that can probably fall back on some educated guesses for parts of speech of unknown
words.
</p><p>
Here's the kicker. If the part of speech is ambiguous at the word level, Marpa can simply figure it out
from context (usually). I think I have a good plan for this, but until I have a reasonable coverage
of parts of speech in my lexicon, I won't have anything to experiment with yet.
</p><p>
Soon, though, I'm going to be able to make some specific contributions to making NLP in Perl a reality.
I've been talking about doing this for a long, long time indeed. It's exciting to be actually making
progress with it for a change.
