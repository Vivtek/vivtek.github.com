<hr>
So again, a lick and a promise for this blog as I madly try to finish some
translation work.  This translation job is an interesting one, though, as
I mentioned, and as it turns out, amenable to editing in a specialized
tool I just wrote today.  Of course, having <i>written</i> the tool today
means I have to <i>use</i> the tool this evening in a mad dash to finish,
which in turn means I have no time to <i>document</i> the code until
tomorrow at the very earliest.
</p><p>
Suffice it to say that the exercise was surprisingly easy.  The task was
simple: I need a tool to edit text files in which (for reasons we'll go into
later) I have a number of phrases, one per line.  The phrases mostly have
all the right words in them, but not in the right order.  I thus need a way
to <i>quickly</i> select one or more words and drag it into the right place
in the phrase.  Sure, you say, Word does that.  Yeah, except that Word
doesn't put the spaces in the right place.  God and Bill Gates alone know
why, but <i>Word doesn't put the fricking spaces in the right place</i> when
I drag words around on a line, and so I took matters into my own hands and
rolled my own solution.  And by God it works!  Still a few little oddities
in it, but it works more quickly than Word for this particular application.
</p><p>
Another nice thing it can do is this: when I drag the first word of a phrase
out into the middle, it can decapitalize that word, and capitalize the new
first word.  That saves me a fraction of a second, and multiplied by 2000
phrases that adds up to a lot of time.
</p><p>
And another little thing I just now added: I can hit a key and toggle the
case of the word the cursor is on.  Again: this may or may not be of general
use, but for this particular application it's very convenient.  And that's
really the idea of special-purpose text editors.  An example from the
programming world is emacs -- you can write LISP code to make emacs do
literally anything at all (including psychoanalysis) from your text editor.
The only problem being that it's too damn hard to start.  Python's easier,
at least for me.  So a text editor in which you can embed your own Python
snippets might be a generally useful tool indeed!
</p><p>
So.  Tomorrow or Sunday, documentation and maybe some more movement on the
drop tagger.  And in the meantime, go get some sleep!  (I know I won't any
time soon.)
