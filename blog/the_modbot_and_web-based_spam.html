As promised, a post on the modbot.
</p><p>
As you know, Bob, I first got into despamming more or less seriously in 1999, when I wrote <a href="http://www.despammed.com">Despammed.com</a> and foisted
it on an unsuspecting world.  And life intervened, as it often does, and Despammed's fortune has waxed and waned along with it, but I still retain
a fascination for the spam.
</p><p>
When XRumer hit the market in November 2006, and everybody suddenly started getting forum spam, I started work on the modbot, which is a set of
Perl code for the detection of spam on the Web.  And you know, there's lots of it.  In the context of various projects, I personally am responsible
for monitoring a <a href="http://www.donttasemeblog.com">MovableType blog</a> (two, actually), a <a href="http://www.nowarblog.org">Scoop installation</a>, a
<a href="http://mondoglobo.wftk.org/wiki/">MediaWiki site</a>, and the venerable old Toonbots forum on <a href="/toonbots/discuss.pl">WebBBS</a>.  And they <i>all get
spam</i>.  The type of spam changes over time.  The modus operandi changes over time.  And I find it all irresistible.
</p><p>
After my first iteration of the modbot, I got distracted for about a year, and all those venues started to accumulate spam, slowly but surely.
The Toonbots forum had some basic spam blocking in place, but it wasn't too effective, and of course MovableType has some fairly decent filters in place
and is moderated anyway, so spam didn't proliferate too badly there.  MediaWiki doesn't seem to be a real spam magnet, either (I suspect it needs a little
more savvy than the low-level help spammers hire can be expected to master.)  And so it was all pretty manageable until...
</p><p>
The nowarblog.org Scoop installation (which I'd nearly forgotten about) was slowly growing in its server demand.  I hadn't realized it for a while, because
I had just assumed it was MediaWiki being the hog it most certainly is.  I recognized that eventually I'd have to track it down, but I'd been quite busy.
But finally, things got so bad I couldn't neglect it any more -- Apache was spending so much time locking the CPU that sendmail wasn't actually getting
me my mail, and that was a problem for the paying work.
</p><p>
So, groaning at the notion I was going to have to get into MediaWiki's PHP and cache it or something, I took a closer look.  And it turned out that
while I wasn't watching, the nowarblog.org Scoop installation had collected 34,000 comments and change.  Shyeeah, like <i>that</i> was gonna happen.  It
was spam.  Scoop doesn't react well to large numbers of comments -- each hit to a spammed page (including every new spam comment post) was hanging on the
CPU for over a minute.  Of course I knew: that meant war.
</p><p>
I dusted off the modbot code, because I wanted to archive the spam properly because <i>eventually</i> I'm going to do some analysis.  And two days later,
there were only twenty comments left on nowarblog.org (not for lack of trying, of course.  The modbot just cleaned up 1400 spam comments this afternoon.)
Next I adapted it to the Toonbots forum; that went well, too.  The modbot is carefully written to be as modular as possible, because spam crops up all
over the place and I want one single way to filter it all.
</p><p>
My next target is MovableType, which has two categories of spam with different characteristics.  There's normal comment spam, and I have a few
techniques which will work well for that.  But the other category is trickier, and blog-specific: trackback spam.  Donttasemeblog.com gets about five
trackback spams a day, and I'm still not entirely sure how to block them.  Ultimately, one test is going to be to check the link being spammed; for
trackbacks, if it forwards to another site, I regard that as spam.  Haven't implemented it yet, though.
</p><p>
MediaWiki spam is going to be tougher still; I'm going to need to write code to back the revisions out carefully, and I'm not yet sure how that's
going to work without shooting myself in the foot.  The really pernicious feature of MW spam, though, is that the spammers typically deface existing
content.  That's really not good.  So it's going to be necessary.
</p><p>
One mode of the modbot is going to have to be email-based.  For simple Web-post forms which deal with email, I want to be able to filter that spam before
it comes to me.  The normal email filters at Despammed, of course, can't begin to deal with that, because as email it's entirely legitimate.  Instead,
a judgement has to be made based on its actual content.  That's on the to-do list, too.
</p><p>
Ultimately, it will be impossible to block spam -- there's no way for a machine to know with absolute certainty who you want to hear from.  But that's
exactly what makes it so very fascinating.  The vast majority of spam is obvious, but sometimes ... sometimes you have to think about it.  And the
natural response of spammers will have to be to get better at spamming.  I truly believe that the spam arms race is where natural computer intelligence
has a good chance of arising.  So ... I despam.  It's my way of immanentizing the Eschaton.
