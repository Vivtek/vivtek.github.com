So.  You're interested in a little more detail.  That's good.  This page is still under
development (as are most of our pages) so if you have any questions at all, please ask them by
<a href=mailto:tech@vivtek.com?subject=Question%20about%20ecomm>emailing us with whatever
concerns you have.</a>  We will certainly answer; we will also try to change the page to make things
a little clearer.
<p>
That said, what kind of details are we going to write about?  Well, first, let's get some words
straight.  In the process of an order, there are three people involved: the <i>customer</i>, the
<i>merchant</i> and the <i>supplier</i>.  The customer is pretty obvious.  The merchant is the person
or company who maintains the Web presence (i.e. the catalog pages) and who takes payment for the
order.  And the supplier is the person or company who actually ships product.  In many cases, the
merchant and the supplier will be one and the same, but not always, especially in business-to-business
commerce.

<tr><td>
A customer first meets our ecomm by looking at a catalog page.  A catalog page is simply an HTML
page, located anywhere at all on the Web.  The catalog page contains an order form which has
an action something like "http://www.vivtek.com/joesgrill/add-order", a number of input fields 
for quantities, and a submit button.  In that action URL, the "joesgrill" part is the tag of the
merchant to whom the order is going.  When the form is submitted, some item or items are added
to the customer's current order (shopping cart) at Joe's Grill.
<p>
All subsequent work with that
order will happen at the Vivtek site; Joe's Grill simply has catalog pages.  However, Joe's site
could, of course, put the order into a frame, so that the customer would never see www.vivtek.com
at all.  All the pages used in the order server are customizable by the merchant, so that the look
of all ecommerce can be integrated into the look of the merchant's site.  If you want more
customization than we currently provide, we can do that.  One of the benefits of
subscribing to our service instead of buying an out-of-box solution is that the original
coders of the software are working with you.  And it really is cheaper.
<p>
Anyway, once something has been added to the current order, the order summary form appears.  This page
lists the items currently in the shopping cart, and provides a place for the customer to enter
contact information (or to sign on if returning), payment information, and shipping information
if the product or products being sold require shipping.  At this point, the customer can place
the order or shop further and place the order later.
<p>
Once the customer is ready to check out, they click on the "Check out" button.  The order server
checks all the information entered and presents a summary of the order, which details the total amount
due, how the customer wants to pay, where the shipment should go, and so forth.
<p>
At this point also,
if payment should be by credit card and the number isn't known, a field will appear for entry.  For this
reason, the summary page is presented via SSL, in other words, it is encrypted coming and going so that
no-one can read the credit card information while it is in transit over the Internet.  This is
fairly straightforward, but many ISPs charge an additional fee for SSL services, and in this case
it all takes place on our server, not the merchant's.
<p>
Once everything is OK, the customer clicks on the confirmation button, and the order is officially placed.
<p>
Order placement sends a summary email to the customer and to the merchant.  If the merchant is
using <a href="/cybercash.html">CyberCash</a> and the customer is paying by credit card, then the transaction is performed on
<a href="/cybercash.html">CyberCash</a> and the results checked.  If there is a problem, the customer is alerted and has a chance
either to go ahead and let the merchant resolve the difficulty, or offer some other form of payment.
If payment clears, then the supplier is also notified (if the supplier and the merchant are the
same email address, then only one email gets sent.)  Otherwise, the supplier won't be notified until
the merchant officially clears payment by hand.
<p>
As a part of the confirmation email, the customer gets a URL which links to the status screen for the
order.  On the order status screen, you can see whether the order, or some items, have been shipped,
and if the supplier has entered tracking information, then you can see that there, too.  If payment
has yet to clear, that is also indicated.  And of course, the customer also gets a customer service
page from which contact information can be changed, payment and shipping preferences entered or
changed, order history can be investigated, and so forth.

Now the customer has placed an order, the ball is in the merchant's court.  An email is sent to the
merchant to inform them of the order.  (We can integrate with your existing systems more completely,
but email is the default notification and it's easy to understand.)  The email contains a list of the
items ordered, warns the merchant if payment hasn't been cleared automatically, and includes a link
to the merchant's order summary.  The summary shows the order and contains links to the customer's
information, an email link to the customer, and transaction information if payment has cleared.
<p>
If payment hasn't cleared, then the merchant needs to take care of it.  This can mean several things.
If the customer wants to mail payment, then the merchant will clear the payment when it arrives.
If the merchant isn't using <a href="/cybercash.html">CyberCash</a> to clear credit cards, then that can be done manually and
the payment marked as cleared.  One way or another, the supplier isn't notified of the order until
payment has cleared.
<p>
The merchant has access to a complete list of orders online, a list of all customers who have placed
orders online, and can optionally set up accounts so that selected customers may place orders
which will automatically be cleared (up to an optional credit limit).  In the case of accounts,
the merchant then invoices on whatever basis works for merchant and customer.  As far as the
commerce platform is concerned, it's all done.
<p>
The merchant can also maintain basic information online (such as mailing address for payments and
the email address that order notifications should go to.)  And at some point we want to include
online catalog management functionality.  We're still working on that; so far setup has been
easy enough that we haven't really had a real need for online management.

Once payment has cleared, it is up to the supplier to complete the order.  Again, the supplier may
be the merchant, but for the purposes of setup and configuration we separate the two functions,
and there are many cases where the online merchant will distribute products for several suppliers.
<p>
The supplier receives an email when an order is ready to fulfill.  (As mentioned above, we can
integrate with your existing systems if necessary, but email is the default notification and is
easy to understand.)  The email contains a list of items provided by that supplier (a given merchant
may represent multiple suppliers and so a given order may contain items from several suppliers.  Each
supplier sees only their own items.)  It also shows the shipping address and contains a link to
the order summary for the supplier.
<p>
The order summary page for each supplier is a very important page, because it is here that shipping
information is entered.  For each line item, the supplier can mark the item shipped on a particular
date, with a particular shipper and tracking number.  The tracking numbers will be made available
to the customer automatically, which can save you a lot of trouble!  And when each item is marked
as shipped, the customer is notified.  The order also has a link to the customer's email on it,
so that if any further information is required, it is easy to obtain.
<p>
The supplier also has access to a number of services besides this, including a list of orders
still to be marked as shipped, the ability to change contact information online, and some
catalog management functionality.
