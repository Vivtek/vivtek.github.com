real life in such a situation.  If printed science fiction authors can stand this rigor, certainly
well-funded moviemakers can, too.</td></tr></table></center>

It's only in the last few years that I have begun to see cinematic science fiction as being
comparable in quality to "real" (that is, written) science fiction.  And since I'm
beginning to see them as real science fiction instead of simple eye candy or fluff, I find myself
expecting more, expecting the visual presentation of a possible scene to be just as true to
the science fiction formula of <i>real scientific theory plus interesting augmentation</i> as
a serious work of science fiction would be.
<p>
So, anal as this may sound, I'm putting together a website about the mistakes that producers
leave in SF movies.  These mistakes leave the general public with misunderstandings about how
the world works, and they're just plain irritating to anyone who knows physics, or computer
science, or whatever.  (I'm told that many legal plots are just as bad, but I'm a member of the
general public where those are concerned, so you won't see those here.)
<p>
The absolute symbol of this type of jarring details is the classic "spaceship banking into the
vacuum," as I think of it.  Since moviemakers have seen planes fly, and since they bank when
they turn, and since spaceships fly, then they must bank into turns, right?  Well, wrong, of
course.  And it just annoys me every time I see it, especially in movies where they seem to have
taken the trouble to do some research.  I assume that the moviemakers would rationalize this
by saying that the public wouldn't accept real spaceship maneuvers, but since the public has
these false expectations because they've only watched movies instead of reading, that seems to 
fall a little flat in my mind.
<p>
So let's watch some movies, OK?
The reviews are sorted by the age of the movie, in case you were wondering.
