<P>&gt; I am trying to get Expat API understand importing for XML files using the
<BR>> ]&gt;
<P>&gt; &amp;test.cfg;
<P>&gt; In the above example all the xml tags from file www.abc.com/test.xml
<BR>> should become part of one XML document and we must be able to read the
<BR>> imported tags. The contents of included file look like:
<P>&gt; 12345 Sun
<P>&gt; This works just fine in my Java XML parser but I am havig trouble to get
<BR>> it to work with expat C/C++ XML parser on Sun Solaris. If you can provide
<BR>> some insight into it It will be greate help.
<P>&gt; Thanks in advance. -Sundeep.
