<P>Good day, This article I've written is all about the fact where I earned an ASTOUNDING amount of money in less than a month and I've decided to share or reveal the secrets behind making big bucks in the Mail Order Business.
<P>So all money seekers, read this carefully.
<P>Hi, I'm 24 years old and I make more money than my parents and so can you&quot; Turn $6.00 into $60,000...read this carefully to find out how!!
<P>Reading this could change your life
<P>I found this on a bulletin board like this one and decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing through several newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, &quot;Yeah right, this must be a scam&quot;, but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you need to send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured: &quot;what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, right?&quot; Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!... within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the lottery!!
<P>Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works.... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy!
<P>SUGGESTION: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage).
<P>IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is virtually no risk - it really works!!!! If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.
<P>PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue it’s success by carefully adhering to the instructions. You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that list.
<P>FHERE ARE 5 EASY STEPS TO GET STARTED
<P>STEP# 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot; Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope ( Please make sure that the bill would not be noticed in the envelope to prevent thievery). Send out US $ DOLLAR, so it would be more acceptable.
<P>STEP# 2: Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them properly. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the phrase, &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot;, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill.
<P>What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting for a legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us, I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!
<P>Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses below:
<P>1) Bob R.
<P>11 Phillips Lane
<P>Lake Groove, NY 11755-2623
<P>2) Almeric Battiste
<P>P.O. Box 450035
<P>Kissimmee, Florida USA 34745
<P>3) Phonexay Khounvongsa
<P>5003 Lakecrest Dr.
<P>Shawnee, KS, USA 66218
<P>4) Tamara Ortiz
<P>2471 Newsom Rd.
<P>Bellville, TX. USA 77418
<P>5) Love Carter
<P>#2 Jericho St.,
<P>Victoria Ville Homes, Antipolo City,
<P>Philippines, 1870
<P>6) Tara Roach
<P>3033 Dogwood Dr.
<P>Troy, Oh 45373
<P>STEP# 3: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list.
<P>STEP# 4: Copy this article. Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original as possible.
<P>STEP#5: Now, post your amended article to at least 200++ newsgroups. (I think there are close to 2.4million groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, US Postal and Lottery Laws or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which states; &quot;a product or service must be exchanged for money received.&quot; The simple note in the letter, &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST&quot;, makes it legal because you are paying for exchange of a service, (adding the purchasers name to his mailing list) for a $1.00 fee.

<P>Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works.... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy!
<P>==========================================
<P>IMPORTANT: Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way.
<P>NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the first six people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business! =============================================== --&gt;DIRECTIONS FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS&lt;--

If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** =======================================
<P>GOOD LUCK to all and please play fairly and reap the huge rewards from this, which is tons of extra CASH. By the way, please DON'T try to deceive people by posting the messages with your name in the list and not sending the CASH to the rest of the people already on the list, you will NOT get any. This is the fairest and most honest way I have ever seen to share the wealth of the world without costing anything but our time!!! You also may want to buy mailing and e-mail lists for future cash. Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW! Also, try to keep a list of everyone that sends you CASH and always keep an eye on the newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly. Remember, HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.
<P>IMPORTANT: If you're not interested to my article, (don't want instant cash?), please pass this message to anyone who wishes quick money. Thank you so much. =======================================
<P>Copy this article from the text box and paste it on a blank notepad file.
<P>Change or edit anything you need to but keep the article as close to original as possible
<P>ALSO REMEMBER: SEND YOUR $1 OUT TO EVERYONE ON THE LIST, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT FROM THE U.S.
<P>NOW, THE WHY PART
<P>Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example) . So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still ONLY 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said, &quot;what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with hundreds of thousands of those joining the actual internet!!!
<P>Remember, Play Fairly and Honestly and this will work for you
