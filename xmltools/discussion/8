<P>I am trying to get Expat API understand importing for XML files using the ]&gt;
<P>&amp;test.cfg;
<P>In the above example all the xml tags from file www.abc.com/test.xml should become part of one XML document and we must be able to read the imported tags. The contents of included file look like:
<P>12345 Sun
<P>This works just fine in my Java XML parser but I am havig trouble to get it to work with expat C/C++ XML parser on Sun Solaris. If you can provide some insight into it It will be greate help.
<P>Thanks in advance. -Sundeep.
<BR>> This board is here for bug/enhancement discussion. If you find xmltools
<BR>> useful, tell me. If not, um.. tell me gently. But sticking this here is my
<BR>> attempt to make things easy. If you have problems making the tools or
<BR>> whatever, bring it up. If you've got patches, mail me.
<P>&gt; Thanks! Michael
