<P><b>Elegant, reusable design of complex systems.</b>  I most enjoy those jobs which 
are vaguely defined and where I can cut through a great deal of troublesome detail to find the elegant core (such as my workflow project
and all the areas it's expanded into).  I enjoy (in a somewhat masochistic way) taking a poorly documented yet powerful system
 (such as Zope) and making it do what I want.  I positively dote on technical translation, because no geek is geekier than the
foreign language geek.  And I'm rather unusual in that I like maintenance coding -- understanding somebody else's mess can be really
informative.</P>
<p>I've been an independent consultant for nine years now, more than half my entire career.  I still have trouble believing that
people pay me to mess around with computers.</p>

<font size=4><i><u><b>Significant accomplishments:</b></u></i></font>
<ul>
<li>The open-source workflow toolkit <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/wftk.html">wftk</a>, which has finally reached production status and
    is expanding from a relatively restricted workflow system into a general dataflow and content management system.  I built it from
    scratch.
<li>The free spam filtration service <a href="http://www.despammed.com">Despammed.com</a>, which was actually a USA Today Hot Site back in
    2001 and is still ticking along, a four-year-old free Internet service.  I built this from scratch, too.
<li>Getting paid to write the occasional technical article.  It's like free money.
</ul>

<font size=4><i><u><b>Technical keywords (the laundry list)</b></u></i></font><br>
A complete list of my technical experience is at the end of this r&eacute;sum&eacute;.<br>
<b>Areas of expertise:</b>: workflow, open-source software engineering, email handling, online searchable databases, personalization, portal design, general active database-backed website design.<br>
<b>Programming languages</b>: C/C++, Java, Javascript even, Tcl, Perl, Python, Visual Basic, and Scheme/LISP.  No, really.  I swear.<br>
<b>Databases</b>: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Access, SQL Server.<br>
<b>Web servers</b>: AOLserver, Apache, IIS, Zope, Medusa.<br>
<b>GUI frameworks</b>: POW (plain ol Windows), wxWindows/wxPython, some Tk.<br>
<p></p>

<I><U><b><FONT SIZE=4>Publications</font></b></u></i><br>
I've got a couple of publications to my name, dating back to when money flowed freely in the good old days (2001, that is).
They're pretty decent articles.  I still get the occasional question or comment.

<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/wftk.html">Workflow toolkit: Case study of an open source project</a><br>
The first article I wrote for pay, this was about my experiences in the original <a href="http://www.vivtek.com/wftk/">wftk project</a>.
I don't care for the article much, as I couldn't really figure out what the heck it was I was writing about, but I recently discovered
it's been <a href="http://www.cn.ibm.com/developerWorks/opensource/wftk/index.shtml">translated into Chinese</a>, so that more than
makes up for its original shortcomings.  Cooool.  Oh, and <a href="http://www-6.ibm.com/jp/developerworks/opensource/001103/j_wftk.html">Japanese</a>.

I really like this article.  It's about Zope; you probably already figured that out, though.  It's all part
of my let-IBM-pay-for-learning-new-tech strategy.  So far this strategy is working out pretty well.

that is useful in a number of different software environments.  The current version is a linkable library; I'm working on
front ends for AOLserver and Zope and a little wxWindows-based standalone front end as well.  I've got backend integration
modules for ODBC and Oracle native OCI, and I'm working on MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Sybase.  It's a neat, neat project.

usability, helped analyze traffic, and did other stuff that fit around the edges of their full-time development staff.
I liked it, they liked it -- it's amazing how well it worked out, really.  Then they grew from 22 to 45 people in
six weeks, and decided to concentrate management on the local staff.  Made sense to me, although I miss it.
