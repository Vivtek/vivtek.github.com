<p>
"Huge, intricate, and ingenious: a chilling, spellbinding dramatization of the
horrors of slavery and mind control." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (pointer review)
<p>
After thousands of years of searching, humans stand on the verge of first
contact with an alien race.  Two human groups: the Qeng Ho, a culture of free,
innovative traders, and the Emergents, a ruthless society based on the
technological enslavement of minds.
<p>
The group that opens trade with the aliens will reap unimaginable riches.  But
first, both groups must wait at the aliens' very doorstep for their strange
star to relight and for the alien planet to reawaken, as it does every two
hundred and fifty years...
<p>
Amidst terrible treachery, the Qeng Ho must fight for their freedom and for the
lives of the unsuspecting innocents on the planet below, while the aliens 
themselves play a role unsuspected by the Qeng Ho and Emergents alike.
<p>
More than just a great science fiction adventure, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>
is a universal drama of courage, self-discovery, and the redemptive power of
love.
<p>
"A feast of imagination.  As always, Vinge satisfies with richly imagined
worlds and a full-flavored story." -- Greg Bear
<p>
"Wonderful.  I love it.  It's every bit as much a mindblower, every bit as
involving and innovative, as <i>A Fire upon the Deep</i>." -- Larry Niven
<p>
"Wonderfully engaging!" -- <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i>

   Vernor Vinge<br>
   <i><font size=-1>1999, 774 pages</font></i>
   <p>
   <table><tr><td><font face=arial>Yet another incredible book from Vinge.  I do wish he'd write more quickly,
but then I guess you can't rush quality.  One thing that occurred to me while
reading this book is that it must be the second book of a trilogy involving
Pham Nuwen; the title of the third book will logically be
"A Skyness in the Fire."
<p>
But joking aside, Vinge has, as usual, provided a uniquely compelling idea --
well, heck, several.  But the notion of Focus, that's gold.  If you could 
just turn it <i>off</i>...  where's the line form?
