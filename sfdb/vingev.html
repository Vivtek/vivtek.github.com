Vinge is one of the few authors really exploring what the information age will
bring us.  His galactic Usenet, though, that's <i>genius</i>.  Come to think
of it, bobbles were genius, too.  Not to mention his post-apocolyptic libertarian
society.  And hey -- Focus.  Applied theology.  The list goes on.  Read everything
you can by Vinge.
