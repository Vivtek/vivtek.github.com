<font size=+2><b>PRIMARY INVERSION</b></font>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>The Skolian Empire rules a third of the
civilized galaxy through its mastery of
faster-than-light communication.  But war
with the rival empire of the Traders seems
imminent, a war that can only lead to
slavery for the Skolians or the destruction
of both sides.  Destructive skirmishes have
already occurred.  A desperate attempt
must be made to avert total disaster.

"Catherine Asaro brings the feel of science back into
science fiction.  Her ftl drive, which rotates a ship around
the lightspeed singularity, is based on pleasant
mathematical concepts.  Fourteen-year-olds who read this
book will probably go out and build a starship when they
are twenty-seven." -- Donald M. Kingsbury
<p>
"In an unusually masterful first novel, physicist Asaro
combines hard speculative science and first-rate
storytelling to look at the galaxy's distant future....
Asaro innovatively blends computer technology and
telepathy into the electrifying, action-rich drama she
creates.  This is one of teh best SF first novels in years."
-- <i>Booklist</i>
<p>
"Asaro takes care to choreograph the major
confrontations for maximum clarity and excitement....
The denouement makes it clear that Primary Inversion
can only be the first volume of a series, a discovery that
should please most fans of tough-minded space
adventure."  -- <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>

   <table><tr><td><font face=arial>Good read, and an incredible first book.  Serious hardline space-opera science
fiction, and -- get this -- a <i>girl</i> wrote it!  Goodness, those 90's sure
were a mixed-up time, weren't they?  Seriously, Asaro's got all the elements of
a great author; very good characters, extremely believable extensions to physics
to allow comfortable things like FTL, more than 4000 settled worlds, psychic
powers, instantaneous interstellar data communications, the whole nine yards.
<p>
Not only is this book a good read, but I read it with the pleasurable knowledge
that an author of this quality will be turning out a good book every year or
two for a long time to come.  Good show!
