Living in exile on a deserted planet, Sauscony and
Jaibriol, each the heir to an interstellar empire, become
entangled in the machinations of the Skolian Empire.
Interstellar war erupts and Jaibriol is snatched away to
be the unwilling ruler of the Highton Aristos.  Sauscony
must lead an invading space fleet to rescue him frmo his
own Empire -- without revealing that they are married.
With much of interstellar civilization poised on the
brink of destruction, it is the devotion of these two
lovers, their sacrifices, and their heroism, that might just
forge a new order.

"Asaro takes care to choreograph the major confrontations
for maximum clarity and excitement.  The novel also contains
a good deal of speculation about cybernetics and
faster-than-light physics.... The denouement makes it clear
that <i>Primary Inversion</i> can only be the first volume of a
series, a discovery that should please most fans of tough-minded
space adventure."   -- <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>
<p>
"Impressive new novel...  The science fictional concepts are
both elegant and piquant, and the storytelling is absolutely
brillian."  -- <i>Romantic Times</i> (4-1/2 out of 5 stars) on
<i>The Radiant Seas</i>

   <table><tr><td><font face=arial>Second of the Skolian/Trader books which I have read, this one's another winner.
Magnificent.  Note that the press doesn't seem to have eaten it up -- they
had to reuse a critical quote about <i>Primary Inversion</i> to fill up the
dust jacket.  Moreover, the jacket writer doesn't seem too familiar with the
story.  A pity.  And I am forced to wonder exactly what a "piquant" concept
tastes like....
<p>
But regardless of jacket quality, Asaro's writing remains brilliant.  The
characterization of the Skolian family is masterful, and this is one of the
few SF books I have ever read which reflects something of the love one has for
one's own children.  I loved this book and it's plain that Asaro is in this for
the long haul.  Yippee!
