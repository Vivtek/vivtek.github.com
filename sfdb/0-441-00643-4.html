     <tr bgcolor=eeeeee><td><b>"This is an engrossing novel by one of the genre's most
accomplished storytellers." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></b>
<p>
<i>The long-awaited new novel from John Varley, winner of the Hugo
and Nebula Awards for excellence in science fiction.</i>
<p>
<i>All the universe is a stage</i>...and Sparky Valentine is its itinerant
thespian.  He makes his way from planet to planet as part of a
motley theater troupe, bringing Shakespeare -- a version of it
anyway -- to the outer reaches of Earth's solar system.  Sparky
can transform himself from young to old, fat to thin, even
male to female, by altering magnetic implants beneath his skin.
Indispensable hardware for a career actor -- and an interstellar
con man wanted for murder...
<p>
<b>"An adventure-packed cross--Solar-System journey...colorful...
intriguing...Varley as delivered some of SF's most palpable
futures, full of memorable, shiny characters and wonder-stimulating
speculations." -- <i>Science Fiction Age</i></b>
<p>
<b>"Varley's ongoing universe...would have been called
cyberpunk had the term been invented when Varley
first appeared...Rich world building." -- <i>Booklist</i></b>
<p>
<b>"Among the best action scenes I've read in recent SF."
 -- <i>Science Fiction Chronicle</i></b>

<b>"Varley is a mind-grabber" -- Roger Zelazny</b>

   <table><tr><td><font face=arial>Wow.  Varley -- well, Varley's Invasion universe is a pretty cool concept.
But that world has always been a little remote.  Until now.  Kenneth Valentine
is just such a living, exuberant, <i>real</i> character that his world comes
to life in a way that I frankly can't remember experiencing since Heinlein.
<p>
You just have to read this book.  Go.  Read it.
