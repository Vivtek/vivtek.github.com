TOUGH, FAST-MOVING, AND VERY WELL-WRITTEN."<br>
- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>
</center>
<p>
Gabriel is an Aristos, one of the elite of human society, a lord of
technology.  On the planet he built, in the Realized World, he is like
a god.
<p>
<b>"ARISTOI is a spectacular, large-scale space opera, in vivid color,
with all the stops pulled out...a successful entertainment which
leaves sobering questions to linger afterward." -- <i>Locus</i></b>
<p>
In the Oneirochronon, Gabriel is only one of many Aristoi, and not
the greatest.  There in the electronic world of the Hyperlogos, the
Aristoi vie for power and prestige in ever-more-complex manipulations
of their common virtual reality.
<p>
<b>"ARISTOI is a highly colorful and inventive science fiction entertainment,
fast-paced and meditative by turns." -- <i>New York Newsday</i></b>
<p>
Gabriel has discovered something that threatens the whole human
race: somewhere in the galaxy is an Aristos who has gone mad.
<p>
<b>"ARISTOI is an immensely ambitious tale, an opulent tour-de-force
... a masterful work." -- <i>Washington Post Book World</i></b>

   <big>Aristoi</big><br>
   Walter Jon Williams<br>
   <i><font size=-1>1992, 449 pages</font></i>
   <p>
   <table><tr><td><font face=arial>This is one of my favorite books.  The idea of computer implantation appeals to
me right at the outset -- but Williams presents an entirely new idea here, the
idea of harnessing multiple personality disorder to improve the data throughput
of the human mind!  Wow!
<p>
And of course the whole idea of any meritocracy of technologically gifted
individuals appeals to all geeks.
<p>
All that aside -- good book.  One of the select few that I think really have
something unique to say about the world.
