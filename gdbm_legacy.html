<i>gdbm</i> is a GNU implementation of the standard Unix <i>dbm</i> library, originally developed at Berkeley.
(Well, what wasn't?)  You may have heard of <i>dbm</i> if you've worked at all with sendmail; sendmail
uses <i>dbm</i> for many of its lookup tables.
<p>
gdbm's features may be summarized as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast</strong><br>gdbm implements a filesystem-based hash table.  It's
extremely fast in comparison to relational databases, because most of the overhead (and the
features) of an RDBMS simply aren't there.
<li><strong>Simple</strong><br>gdbm is very simple to include into your C programs.
<li><strong>Open-source</strong><br>gdbm is probably perfect.  But in the event it's not, you 
can fix it yourself.
</ul>
<p>
Thus gdbm is an excellent lightweight alternative to a full relational database.  If all you
need to do is to store arbitrary data to be looked up with keys, and do it fast, then gdbm is
your solution.  However, there are a few caveats.
<ul>
<li><strong>One writer, many readers.</strong><br>Only one process may have a gdbm file open
at a given time, and this is an exclusive lock: when a file is open for writing, no readers may
open it.  When the file is <i>not</i> open for writing, any number of readers may open it.  So gdbm
is really optimal only in the case where a file is written seldom and used for lookup, or when
only one process needs to use the file anyway (and thus may open it for writing and reading
simultaneously.)  The latter case makes more sense than you might think (why wouldn't you just
use a hash table?) because gdbm provides a persistent storage for the hash.
<li><strong>Multiple standards.</strong><br>Well, kind of.  The problem is, in the dbm world,
there is original dbm, "new" ndbm, and GNU gdbm.  They all use different file formats, so to
use an original dbm file with gdbm you have to convert it (there is a utility to do so.)  gdbm
provides a dbm compatibility mode -- but in that mode you can only open one file at a time because
the functions don't include a file pointer!
<li><strong>Is data null-terminated or not?</strong><br>dbm files don't necessarily need to have
their data terminated by <code>\0</code> -- but since C is normally used to access them, they
very often do.  Since "key" may be different from "key\0", if you're working with a dbm file used
by a different program, you need to be aware of the convention used by that program.  After reading
the man pages for gdbm, you may be wondering how the heck the data <i>is</i> used, since it's
not really documented.  Keys as well as data are manipulated using type <code>datum</code>, which is
simply a structure
<pre>
typedef struct {
   char *dptr;
   int  dsize;
} datum;
</pre>
So if you're using null-terminated strings, then you can simply toss that <code>dptr</code> into
any normal string function, but otherwise, if you need to handle the data as strings, the
your best bet is to <code>malloc</code> a buffer of 
size <code>dsize + 1</code>, use <code>strncpy</code> to get the data into your buffer, and
then explicitly write your null terminator in at the end.
<li><strong>Memory management</strong><br>When gdbm fetches a datum from a file, it <code>malloc</code>s
the buffer for you and returns the datum -- but that means, of course, that you have to free the
buffer yourself!  Failure to do so, as always, will work fine until you go into production
and everybody's watching, at which point your process will crash and burn from the memory leaks.
