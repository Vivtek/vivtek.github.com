David Medinetsmedined@mtolive.coman equivalent project in javaHi. I've been working on an equivalent project using Java. It's hosted on sourceforge.net and called CfDoc because I originally wanted to document ColdFusion templates. But my architecture is similar to yours, I believe. I just haven't documented it as much. In fact, if you don't mind, I can probably 'borrow' some of your words. <P>I look forward to seeing how you progress...
