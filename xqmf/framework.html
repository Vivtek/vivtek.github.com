OK, I'm going to cop out on this page for the time being, because it's late and I want to
upload this tonight.  So consider this a promise for later.
<p>
The framework code consists of two scripts at the moment: xqmf_init.pl is run in a local
directory and creates a first stab at a project file.  This goes into 'xqmf.xml' in that
directory.  Later this would be a reasonable place to ask questions and such, but that will
be later -- right now, you run this, then you go edit it to eliminate files you don't
care about, tweak types, assign a different storage, and connect a database.
<p>
The second script is the framework, really.  It's xqmf_update.pl and it:<ul>
<li>Opens the project file.
<li>Creates the storage directory if necessary.
<li>Assigns file tags to each file that doesn't have one.
<li>If a file is new or changed, it queues any initial analyzers that say they're interested.
<li>Then it runs through the queue executing analyzers.
<li>As each file is analyzed, the results are tossed to the database.
<li>Afterwards, CVS will be invoked (not there yet).
<li>Finally, the storage directory will be decorated with some autoreports showing an overview
of the project and its state (not there yet).  Eventually this will be configurable as well,
so that you can run XQMF on a project, sight unseen, and get a general overview of its
state in the terms you understand best.
</ul>

Everything is XML files and yeah, I eschewed all the existing XML implementations in favor
of my own half-baked one.  Well, in my defense I need the half-baked one elsewhere, but more
than that I'm not sure of the broad availability of the existing XML implementations for
Perl.  I like to write for the lowest common denominator.
