<div class="title">Session one: Introduction to Logo</div>
All these lesson plans or whatever you want to call them are based on <a href="http://fmslogo.sourceforge.net/">FMSlogo</a>, which is an open-source (kind of) Windows Logo system using UCB Logo.  There are a number of good Logo systems, though, and everything we do here will probably work fine on any of them.
</p><p>
As an introduction, I didn't want to do a whole lot.  Mostly I just wanted to introduce three things:
</p><p>
1. The turtle graphics system as a whole.<br>
2. The concept of loops.<br>
3. The concept of stored functions.
</p><p>
A little side note here, before we begin.  I'm writing this lesson plan to two very different audiences.  The first is the actual programmer who would like to teach a kid to program (whether his or her own kid, or a niece, or the neighbor's kid, or whoever).  The professional programmer probably started around puberty, with BASIC (if you're old like me) or whatever you young folks use to learn programming today.  And now you use Java, or C++, or Python, or Perl.  It may come as a surprise to discover that it's <i>impossible</i> to start a kid on Java or C++ or Python or Perl -- I've tried (with Perl) -- because there is very little immediate gratification.  The baby steps are boring, unless you know why you're doing them.  Hence Logo, where the baby steps -- pushing a turtle around the screen -- are already fun, and can act as a gateway to programming.
</p><p>
The second audience is the homeschooling parent.  If you're a homeschooling parent but not a programmer, you'd almost certainly like to give your kids the relevant skills for computer programming, but you haven't the faintest idea how to start.  You've already read about Logo or you wouldn't have found this page, and maybe you've already installed Logo and pointed the kids at it, without luck (I know; I've been there).  You need to direct them, but you don't know where to start.  This series of lesson plans will give you a place to start -- where your kids take it is up to them.
</p><p>
There's a third audience, the professional teacher.  You'll find some good stuff here, too, but the organization of these pages is probably going to be a little weird for you.  I'll try to mostly make things look like lesson plans, but mostly I'm going to be chatting to the adults who are engaged with the kids.
</p><p>
Anyway, I'm going to try to keep things as brief as possible for the programmers, while trying not to make things too technically daunting for the home schoolers.  Wish me luck.
</p><p>
A note on Logo for either audience: don't fall into the trap of thinking Logo is  a toy language.  On the inside, it's effectively LISP (which is an academically popular language used in artificial intelligence programming).  You can do anything in Logo you can do in any other language; the only limitation is the fact that the existing frameworks are not geared towards release of software products.
</p><p>
But a child (or anybody) who learns to program in Logo will find it easy to pick up new programming languages.  The skills you learn in one language transfer just fine -- of course, you need to relearn all the specific commands and functions, and probably some new concepts about the environment, but programming is programming.  It's a mindset.  If your kids key in on Logo, they'll be unstoppable if they want to program anything else.
</p><p>
So.  I'm out of time for today.  If you actually stumble across this before I finish it, complain to me and it will make my day.
