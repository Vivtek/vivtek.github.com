<div class="title">Programming with Logo</div>
After a couple of false starts teaching my kids to program, I've finally hit on Logo (again).  I'm not sure why it didn't work last time, but this time, my 14-year-old daughter has really taken to it, while my 9-year-old son is still somewhat frustrated with the whole thing, but has still done some amazing things.
</p><p>
So far, this is what we've done (more accurately, it's what I've written up), and some ideas I've had for further work.  For the first couple of sessions, I had both kids work together, but I'm considering doing more one-on-one work in the future, since their interests differ.
</p><p>
<a href=intro.html>Session one: Introduction to Logo</a>
</p><p>
<a href=polygons.html>Session two: Polygons</a>
</p><p>
<a href=fractals.html>Session three (to come): Fractals</a>
</p><p>
<a href=animation.html>Session n (sometime): Animation</a>
</p><p>
The idea is to appeal to the entire child -- the math skills, the artistic talent, the plain fun of telling robots what to do.
</p><p>
We all like pretty pictures, and Logo allows us to generate them with a very small amount of effort, while making pleasant discoveries about the mathematics behind some very nice pictures indeed.  The overhead needed to get started is incredibly small; however, children really benefit from detailed guidance.  In other words, just installing Logo and telling a child, "Hey, come play with this" won't work.  (I tried that once.  It didn't work.)
</p><p>
Instead, install Logo, then say, "Hey, come type 'fd' and then 'rt' and 'fd' again and see what happens."  Then show them "repeat" for loops.  <i>That</i> will work.  While I was still showing my son how to draw squares of different sizes, my daughter was trying to build a dragonfly out of squares, and asking how to set the pen color.
</p><p>
Anyway, I'm not sure how detailed these pages will get, but if you're happening across them and want to see something more specific or just say hi, drop me a line at michael@vivtek.com -- especially if you're home schooling.  It <i>is</i> possible for the home schooler to learn programming, even if you yourself can barely start a computer (they'll help you start the computer, of course -- and then you can all learn programming together!)
