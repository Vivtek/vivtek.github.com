<div class="title">CAPTCHA interpretation</div>
So lately I've been hacking for pay over at <a href="http://www.elance.com">Elance</a>, and one of those little scripts involved retrieving backlinks from Google.
Turns out Google, since they know everything about everybody online, is target #1 for anybody trying to game systems.  (My own Googlecount being one
such script, of course.)  So Google has implemented an anti-robot policy which, when you search it too fast for too many things, will flag your IP as a
machine, causing further searches to trigger a CAPTCHA.  This breaks my script, permanently.  (So I switched to Yahoo -- they offer an export feature
anyway.)
 
Well.  Normally, as you know, I'm firmly on the side of anything that weeds out bots online -- but this is different!  Mostly because I was writing this
bot, of course, but ... well, accuse me of hypocrisy if you will, but CAPTCHA breaking turns out to be a pretty neat subject, involving, as it does,
simulation of human visual skills.  Weak tea as far as real AI goes, of course, but ... intriguing.  So let's ignore any ethical aspects, and <i>look! shiny thing!</i>
</p><p>
As Google's CAPTCHA goes, it's good.  Of course.  Google isn't known for turning out shoddy services.  But as a weak-tea AI problem, Google's CAPTCHA
looks, to this naive researcher, like a pretty good problem.  Here are some samples:
</p><p>
<img src="sorry1.jpg"/><img src="sorry2.jpg"/><img src="sorry3.jpg"/>
</p><p>
I call this a "good" problem because it eliminates irritation for me (in that there are no extraneous lines or color variations, both of which would
be boring things to solve) while being hard for OCR (because the characters are deformed and often overlap, the "words" are not dictionary words,
the length of the words
varies, and so on).  Another interesting aspect is that the target strings are meant to be easy to remember, while still not being actual words.  So
there are syllable rules to narrow down possible solutions, but the rules don't seem inviolable -- very soft and AI-like.
</p><p>
So it's a juicy problem!
</p><p>
A little background: Google serves up these strings from requests of the form http://www.google.com/sorry/image?id=<number>, where <number> is a
number of about a dozen digits.  You've got a limited amount of time to recognize the CAPTCHA and respond, because the set of images served for a given
number changes regularly.  It would be an interesting, but not AI-like, ancillary problem to reverse-engineer Google's algorithm for this, because ...
well, just because I find that kind of stuff interesting, I guess.  It would be fun to see if there's any regularity there, or just random numbers.
It would also be fun to derive Google's syllable rules, but to do that, we're going to have to break the CAPTCHA first.
</p><p>
Now, as I understand it, OCR is generally a statistical process.  It relies on characters being well-aligned, and frankly, the open-source OCR routines
out there are pretty crappy.  (And not accessible from Python, as I've complained before, but that's a different story.)  The freely accessible solutions
to this, therefore, don't stand a chance of figuring out Google's CAPTCHAs.  (Of course.  That's kind of the point of CAPTCHA.)
</p><p>
The way everybody seems to break CAPTCHAs instead is this:
</p><p>
1. Break things up into characters, if possible (with multiple possiblities if necessary).
</p><p>
2. Find visual features for the candidate characters.
</p><p>
3. Feed those visual features into a recognition algorithm.
</p><p>
4. If you've got multiple possibilities, weed them out with string rules.
</p><p>
5. Cross your fingers.
</p><p>
It's those visual features that are the key.  I want to try tracing the lines, and coming up with the features I think <i>I</i> use when reading these.
I'm thinking of topological features like loops and lines, and font features like serifs.  Overall, since the deformation of neighboring characters
seems to be mostly related, I'd like to indicate that ("bent to the right" or something).
</p><p>
But I probably won't have any time.  We'll see.
