<div class="title">Programming with the PyPop GUI framework</div>
<hr>
<div class="t2">A brief history of PyPop</div>
<p>
The PyPop GUI framework originated in my <a href="/wftk.html">wftk open-source workflow toolkit</a> project.  Every time I approached something
GUI-related, I felt the need to package the definition of GUI projects in a more concise way, and so years passed and I avoided doing anything
GUI-based.  But in late 2006, I ran across the "Software Jedi", Dana Hanna, who had undertaken the crazy project of developing an application,
albeit a small one, every day for a month.  He blogged the experience at <a href="http://www.anappaday.com">Anappaday.com</a>, and gained some
notoriety.  And he had a forum where people could suggest or request additional little apps of that nature.  Well -- long story short, his month
basically burned him out, and he was looking for somebody else to take up the task, but perhaps with a somewhat longer timeframe.  I agreed to do
it -- at <a href="http://www.anappaweek.com">Anappa<i>week</i>.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
It didn't take long -- app #2, in fact -- before the urge to rejuvenate my GUI framework was overpowering.  I developed app #2, the filetagger,
based on the <a href="/wftk/doc/code/python/wxpywf.html">WxPyWf framework</a>, which is a Python wrapper for both wxWidgets and wftk.  And I used
the MacMillan installer to package it for distribution.  But it was really big, even for a very small app, because wxWidgets is itself rather large.
So it occurred to me that if I wanted to install multiple such apps on a single machine, the overhead would be offensive.  To me, anyway.
</p>
<p>
And so my generic idea for a general-purpose wrapper for the WxPyWf, <a href="/wftk/doc/code/python/pypop.html">PyPop</a>, was the natural next step.
The WxPyWf organizes most of the application-specific code into command-line interfaces, and so I figured I could just import such an interface
definition in Python as an auxiliary file, and distribute apps as small groups of text files, to be run by a single PyPop instance.
The epiphany came when I realized that given Python's magic powers, I could <i>generate</i> the Python code for a command-line interface class
and interpret it on the fly.  Python is cool that way.  And so that's just what I did; PyPop can define an entire (small) application in a single
XML file, including the definition of the UI, all actions taken by the UI, command-line specifications, and a specification of the data structure
saved and loaded by the app.
</p>

<div class="t2">A PyPop application</div>
<p>
So a PyPop application consists of a single XML file, saved with the extension ".wftk" by default.  (The PyPop installer registers that so you
can double-click the app and it will run automagically.)  You can also store apps into the PyPop installation directory, in the <code>apps</code>
folder.  If you do that, you can run PyPop with the app name on the command line (but without the extension) and it will run the appropriate app.
</p>
<p>
The <i>simplest possible PyPop app</i> is probably this:
</p>
<pre class="code">
(unresolved tag quote example1.wftk)</pre>
<p>When run, it simply looks like this:<img src="example1.png"></p>
