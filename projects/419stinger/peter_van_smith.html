Interesting: note that the Yahoo addy is invalid, and this was not
sent through Yahoo, but from a DSL line (presumably).  I have five
sets of headers from Peter.  They're all different.  The bodies
are the same; these are the headers I responded to.

<div class="subtitle">The original text, my highlighting</div>
<p>
Dear Friend,
</p><p> 
I am <b>Barrister Peter Van Smith</b>, a solicitor at law. I was the personal
attorney to <b>Eng, John McPherson</b>, a national of your country who used to 
work with an <b>oil servicing company here in Amsterdam-Netherlands</b> after
which be referred to as my client. 
Eng, John McPherson 62 years of age made a fixed deposit of fund valued  at
<b>USD$14,500,000</b> (Fourteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars Only) with a Security Company/Finance Firm here in Europe and
unfortunately lost his life in an Egyptian charter plane Boeing 737 .
which crashed into the Red Sea early on January 3 shortly after taking off
from the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all the 135 passengers and 13 
crew members aboard, Ref: (View:
http://english.people.com.cn/200401/04/eng20040104_131791.shtml ). He left
no clear beneficiary as Next of Kin except 
some vital documents related to the deposit still in my possession.
</p><p> 
Recently, the governing body of the Security Company/Finance Firm contacted
me on this matter, requesting that I should notify the next of kin of 
my late client to claim the funds and I am yet to provide the Next of Kin
to lay claims to the Fund. I know that my client had no living next of kin 
but I went ahead and made several inquiries to your embassy to locate any
of my late clients extended relatives but this has proved unsuccessful.
Under 
a clear and legitimate agreement with you, I seek your consent to present
you as the next so that my late client's fund will not be confiscated by 
the Security Company.
You and I can share the money, you will be entitled to <b>50%</b> of the total
fund for your role as the relative and next of kin of my late client, 
40% for me while 10% is to be marked out for any expenses that will be
incurred during the clearance or process of transfer of the fund to your
bank
account. Be informed that there is no risk involved as all necessary legal
document which will be used to back you up as the legal beneficiary and 
next of kin of my late client will be procured.
</p><p> 
All I require is your sincerity, honesty, co-operation and utmost good
faiths to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will 
be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law. Kindly, get in touch with me by my e-mail
(peter_vansmith@yahoo.co.uk) or telephone to enable us discuss further.
You may also send your telephone number so that I can call you. Do not 
forget that a transaction of this magnitude require utmost confidentiality
and sincerity. I look forward to your urgent response.
</p><p> 
Thank you, 
Peter Van Smith

<p>
Today, Peter answered me.  Hee, hee.
</p>
<p>
Dear Michael,

</p><p>
Thanks for your response to my letter, all that is required is for you to stand in as the next of kin to my late client. There is no risk of whatsoever involved in this transaction as all necessary legal documents will be obtained by us to justify your claim as relative of the deceased.

</p><p>
I need you to re-confirm your full name as it should appear on the legal documents, contact address, sex, age, occupation, telephone and fax numbers to enable me proceed to the International Court of Justice to obtain the Sworn Affidavit documents declaring you as the next of kin of my late client and beneficiary of the fund deposited with the Security Company. I will then forward the document to the Security Company for immediate claim of fund in your favour.

</p><p>
As soon as the document is received by them, you will be contact by the Security Company for confirmation and notification of the fund release processes. Do not fail to notify me once you are contacted so that I can give you more directions and advice. I want you to understand that I need your sincerity, assistance and cooperation to see this deal through.

</p><p>
Thank you for your good understanding; hopefully we should have the fund released on or before 31st Jan. 2007. I hope to hear from you shortly and do not forget that a transaction of this magnitude must be kept confidential until everything is finalized to avoid unnecessary exposures. You should call me on my direct line for further discussion.

</p><p>
Regards,
Peter Van Smith
