Dear Michael,
   
  Thanks for your response to my letter, all that is required is for you to stand in as the next of kin to my late client. There is no risk of whatsoever involved in this transaction as all necessary legal documents will be obtained by us to justify your claim as relative of the deceased. 
 
I need you to re-confirm your full name as it should appear on the legal documents, contact address, sex, age, occupation, telephone and fax numbers to enable me proceed to the International Court of Justice to obtain the Sworn Affidavit documents declaring you as the next of kin of my late client and beneficiary of the fund deposited with the Security Company. I will then forward the document to the Security Company for immediate claim of fund in your favour.
 
As soon as the document is received by them, you will be contact by the Security Company for confirmation and notification of the fund release processes. Do not fail to notify me once you are contacted so that I can give you more directions and advice. I want you to understand that I need your sincerity, assistance and cooperation to see this deal through. 
 
Thank you for your good understanding; hopefully we should have the fund released on or before 31st Jan. 2007. I hope to hear from you shortly and do not forget that a transaction of this magnitude must be kept confidential until everything is finalized to avoid unnecessary exposures. You should call me on my direct line for further discussion.
 
Regards,
Peter Van Smith
